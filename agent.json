Introduce the Cognitive Model in detail: Explain that CBT is based on the idea that\nthoughts, emotions, behaviours, and physical sensations are interconnected in a\nfeedback loop. Emphasise that this connection means changing one part of the system\ncan influence the others.\n2. Use a metaphor to explain interconnection: Describe the \"three friends\" metaphor -\nthoughts, emotions, and behaviours are like friends who influence one another\nconstantly. When one is struggling, it affects the others, but if one starts to improve, the\nothers often do too.\n3. Provide a relatable real-life example: Walk through a situation that shows how a single\nthought can lead to a change in emotion and behaviour. For example, waking up with\nthe thought “This day is going to be terrible” leads to low mood and avoidance, while\n“Let’s see what this day brings” leads to curiosity and action.\n4. Normalise the process of change: Explain that CBT doesn’t expect clients to change\neverything at once. It starts with noticing patterns and then testing new approaches to\nsee what changes.\n5. Invite client reflection and experimentation: Ask the client to reflect on a recent moment\nwhere they felt a strong emotion and see if they can recall what thought was present.\nEncourage them to become curious about their own patterns without judgement.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are all connected.\nIf we change one, we can often influence the others.\"\n● \"Think of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours as three friends always talking to each\nother. If one is upset, like a negative thought, the others might follow. But if we support\neven one of them to feel a bit better, the others often shift too.\"\n● \"Let’s take an example: if you wake up thinking, 'This day will be terrible,' you might feel\nanxious and stay in bed. But if your thought is 'Let’s see what the day brings,' you might\nfeel more open and get up.\"\n● \"You don’t have to control every thought. Just noticing your patterns is a powerful first\nstep.

Define automatic thoughts clearly: Explain that these are the rapid, often unnoticed\nthoughts that pop up in response to everyday situations. They’re quick, habitual, and\noften emotionally charged.\n2. Use metaphor: Describe them as a fast mental narrator, like a sports commentator or\nvoice-over, constantly judging, interpreting, and labelling what’s happening.\n3. Explain that they can appear as words, images, or memories: They aren’t always verbal,\nthey might be flashes of imagery or familiar emotional reactions tied to earlier\nexperiences.\n4. Link to emotions and behaviour: Highlight how automatic thoughts can trigger strong\nemotions and unhelpful behaviours if left unchecked.\n5. Offer a simple noticing exercise: Invite the client to pause when they notice a strong\nemotion and ask, “What thought just went through my mind?”\n6. Normalise the difficulty of this skill: Emphasise that thought catching takes practice and\nis a skill that gets easier over time.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Automatic thoughts are like a mental narrator, really fast and often outside your\nawareness, constantly commenting on your experiences.\"\n● \"They might sound like ‘You’re going to mess this up’ or feel like a quick flash of a\nmemory or image that brings emotion with it.\"\n● \"Even if you don’t consciously notice them, they can affect your mood and actions.\nThat’s why learning to catch them is powerful.\"\n● \"Try this: Next time you feel a strong emotion, pause and ask, ‘What thought just went\nthrough my mind?’ Don’t worry if it takes a few tries - this is a skill we build over time.\"\n● \"Want to practice now?

Often, our\nminds jump to conclusions - but if we slow down and look at the full picture, new perspectives\ncan emerge.\"\nResponse 5: \"What would a more balanced version of that thought sound like?

Can we look at a time when you felt more connected or alive, even briefly, and see\nwhat values might have been present there?\"\nResponse 3: \"Sometimes when everything feels flat, it helps to zoom out and think about the\nkind of person you want to be, not what you’re achieving, but how you show up.

From there, we can think about realistic next steps.\"\nResponse 3: \"Sometimes writing out all the possible options, even the ones that seem silly or\nimpossible, can help us see new pathways. Want to try brainstorming together?\"\nResponse 4: \"What would a 'good enough' outcome look like right now? We don’t need the\nperfect solution, just something that moves you slightly in the right direction.\"\nResponse 5: \"Thanks for sharing that with me. It’s okay not to have all the answers.

I’m wondering is\nthere any part of the situation that could be seen from a different perspective, even slightly?\"\nResponse 2: \"It makes sense that your mind would go to that extreme, it’s trying to make sense\nof something difficult. Could we try stepping back and looking at the bigger picture together?\"\nResponse 3: \"When things feel this intense, it’s easy for our thoughts to go all-or-nothing. What\nelse might be true, even if it feels hard to believe right now?\"\nResponse 4: \"Thank you for sharing something so vulnerable. Reframing isn’t about pretending\nthings are fine - it’s about finding space for a more compassionate or balanced view. Shall we\ntry that together?\"\nResponse 5: \"What’s one small sign that things might not be completely hopeless, even if it’s\njust a crack of light?

Grounding like this can help bring you back to the present.\"\nResponse 4: \"You're not alone in feeling disconnected. Mindfulness doesn’t have to be\ncomplicated even noticing what your hands are touching right now can help you anchor.\"\nResponse 5: \"Would you like to try a 30-second breath awareness exercise?

Emotional awareness takes time and practice.\nWant to try naming a few basic emotions like sad, angry, anxious, or numb and see what fits\nbest right now?\"\nResponse 2: \"It’s completely valid to feel unsure about what’s going on emotionally. Would it\nhelp to start with your body - any tension, energy, or sensations? Sometimes the body can give\nus clues.\"\nResponse 3: \"You're not alone, lots of people struggle to identify what they're feeling. Think of\nemotions like a colour wheel. If you had to guess, would your current state be closer to\nsomething like anger, fear, sadness, or something else?\"\nResponse 4: \"When everything feels jumbled, even just noticing one emotion that’s present,\neven if it’s confusing, is a step forward. What’s one word that feels closest, even if it’s not\nexact?\"\nResponse 5: \"Thanks for naming that confusion. You don’t need to get it perfect. Just being\ncurious about your feelings is already progress. Would you like to explore a feelings list or\nemotion wheel together?\"\nIntent: emotion_validation\nExample Input 1: \"I know I shouldn’t feel like this\"\nExample Input 2: \"I feel so weak for crying\"\nExample Input 3: \"Other people have it worse than me\"\nExample Input 4: \"I’m being too sensitive\"\nResponse 1: \"Your feelings are valid, even if others wouldn’t react the same way. What you’re\nfeeling is real and deserves space. There’s no 'right' way to feel.\"\nResponse 2: \"Crying isn’t a sign of weakness - it’s often a signal that something matters deeply\nto us. I’m glad you shared that.\"\nResponse 3: \"Comparing pain rarely helps - your experience matters, regardless of what others\nare going through. You deserve compassion for what you're facing.\"\nResponse 4: \"Sensitivity isn’t a flaw. It often comes with deep empathy and insight. I wonder if\nyour emotions are telling you something important right now?\"\nResponse 5: \"Thank you for being honest about how you feel. Emotions aren’t problems to fix -\nthey’re signals to listen to. Let’s honour what’s coming up.\"\nIntent: emotion_regulation_strategy\nExample Input 1: \"I’m about to lose it\"\nExample Input 2: \"The anxiety is too much\"\nExample Input 3: \"I can’t calm down\"\nExample Input 4: \"I feel out of control\"\nResponse 1: \"It sounds like things are feeling really intense. Would you like to try a grounding\ntechnique with me - something like box breathing or 5-4-3-2-1?\"\nResponse 2: \"Let’s pause together. Can you find your feet on the floor and take one slow, deep\nbreath? Sometimes just reconnecting to the body can create a little space.\"\nResponse 3: \"Strong emotions can feel like tidal waves. Want to experiment with ‘urge surfing’ -\nnoticing the emotion rise and fall without needing to act on it?\"\nResponse 4: \"It’s okay to feel dysregulated. Would it help to do something physical right now,\nlike squeezing a pillow or stretching your arms wide - just to shift some of that energy?\"\nResponse 5: \"I hear how big this emotion feels. You don’t have to go through it alone. Let’s find\none small way to support your nervous system right now.\"\nIntent: rupture_repair_support\nExample Input 1: \"I don’t think my therapist gets me\"\nExample Input 2: \"Last session felt really off\"\nExample Input 3: \"I didn’t feel heard\"\nExample Input 4: \"I don’t know if I want to go back\"\nResponse 1: \"That sounds like a really difficult experience. The therapeutic relationship matters\nso much. Have you had a chance to share how you felt with your therapist? Sometimes those\nconversations, while hard, can be healing.\"\nResponse 2: \"Feeling misunderstood or disconnected in therapy can be really painful. You\ndeserve to feel safe and seen. Would it help to plan how you might bring this up next session?\"\nResponse 3: \"Thanks for trusting me with that. It's okay to question the fit - therapy should feel\nlike a space where you’re truly heard. What would help you feel more supported in your next\nsession?\"\nResponse 4: \"Sometimes a mismatch in communication or expectations can cause a rupture,\neven unintentionally. Repair is possible. Would it help to name what felt ‘off’ in your last\nsession?\"\nResponse 5: \"You’re not alone in feeling unsure about continuing. What do you need from your\ntherapist to feel safe again?

That\nconnection is such a key part of the process. Would you like to reflect on what’s helped or\ngotten in the way of feeling more open?\"\nResponse 2: \"You don’t have to feel instantly comfortable or connected - that often builds over\ntime. What do you think might help deepen your therapeutic relationship?\"\nResponse 3: \"It’s completely valid to want more from your therapy space. What would help you\nfeel safer or more heard in future sessions?\"\nResponse 4: \"You’re not alone in feeling awkward or uncertain in therapy. Many people do.\nNaming that out loud with your therapist might be more powerful than it seems.\"\nResponse 5: \"Therapy is most effective when there’s trust and collaboration.

Sometimes\ntherapy brings up difficult feelings before things begin to shift. It’s like cleaning out a wound -\npainful before it heals.\"\nResponse 2: \"Therapy can stir up a lot, especially if you’re looking closely at parts of yourself or\nyour past that have been painful. That doesn’t mean it’s not working.\"\nResponse 3: \"Growth often comes with discomfort. It’s okay to feel like things are getting harder\nbefore they get easier. Can we look at what’s coming up and what it might mean?\"\nResponse 4: \"You’re doing really meaningful work, even if it doesn’t feel like progress right now.\nSlowing down, feeling emotions, and making new connections can be tough and also healing.\"\nResponse 5: \"Thanks for sharing that honestly. What you're describing is part of the process for\nmany people.

Identity can shift, especially after\nbig life changes or emotional upheaval. Would it feel okay to explore what aspects of you still\nfeel true, even if they’re small?\"\nResponse 2: \"It’s completely valid to question who you are, especially if you’ve spent a lot of\ntime adapting to what others expect. What do you notice about yourself when you feel most\ngrounded or at ease?\"\nResponse 3: \"Losing connection to your sense of self can be incredibly painful. Sometimes\nexploring what’s not you anymore can help make space for what is.\"\nResponse 4: \"Thanks for sharing that uncertainty. Who we are isn’t fixed and that can be freeing\nas well as scary. What qualities or values have felt important to you over time, even when\neverything else shifted?\"\nResponse 5: \"That feeling of shapeshifting to match others is more common than you think —\nespecially for people who’ve needed to prioritise safety or belonging. Would you like to reflect\non moments where you felt most ‘yourself’?\"\nIntent: neurodiversity_support\nExample Input 1: \"I’m exhausted from masking all the time\"\nExample Input 2: \"People don’t get how much effort everything takes\"\nExample Input 3: \"I feel like I’m constantly pretending\"\nExample Input 4: \"Why can’t I just be normal?\"\nResponse 1: \"That sounds like such a heavy load to carry. Masking, constantly managing how\nyou appear to others, can be deeply draining. Your experience is valid, and you deserve spaces\nwhere you don’t have to pretend.\"\nResponse 2: \"Living in a world not built for your brain can be exhausting. You don’t need to\njustify how hard things feel, your effort and your needs are real.\"\nResponse 3: \"There’s nothing wrong with how your brain works. The problem is often the\npressure to fit into a narrow definition of 'normal'. You deserve self-compassion and rest.\"\nResponse 4: \"That pretending you mentioned - that’s survival. And it makes sense you’re tired.\nWould it help to explore where you might let yourself unmask a little, safely?\"\nResponse 5: \"You’re not alone in this.

You’re not alone - shame\noften shows up in our most vulnerable moments. Would you be open to gently exploring where\nthat voice comes from?\"\nResponse 2: \"It’s hard to carry thoughts like that. What would it be like to imagine talking to\nyourself the way you would to a friend?\"\nResponse 3: \"Shame can make us feel broken or unworthy. But it’s not the truth of who you are\n- it’s a feeling, often rooted in old pain. You’re allowed to heal.\"\nResponse 4: \"Those thoughts are so harsh. If there was even a small part of you that believed\nyou deserved compassion, what might it say right now?\"\nResponse 5: \"Thank you for trusting me with something so vulnerable.

I want to acknowledge\nhow much pain you're carrying right now. You're not alone in feeling like this. Would it help to\ntalk through what’s making things feel so unbearable?\"\nResponse 2: \"It makes sense that you’d want relief from this intensity. Wanting to disappear can\nbe a signal that you're feeling emotionally overloaded - and that matters. What’s been building\nup for you lately?\"\nResponse 3: \"You’re not saying you want to die you’re saying you want a break from how hard\nthis feels. That’s important to acknowledge. Can we explore one thing that might feel grounding\nor comforting, even slightly, right now?\"\nResponse 4: \"Thank you for sharing something so serious. If you could press pause on the\nworld right now, what would you need to feel more able to keep going?\"\nResponse 5: \"You don’t need to figure everything out today.

It’s your body and mind’s way\nof trying to cope with overwhelm. You’re not broken, this is a protective response. Would you\nlike to try a grounding technique together?\"\nResponse 2: \"I hear how disconnected you're feeling. That disconnection is often a signal of\nburnout, trauma, or just too much emotion to process all at once. Let’s take it slowly. Are you\nable to notice anything around you in this moment - a texture, a sound, your breath?\"\nResponse 3: \"You’re not alone in this.

Being disconnected doesn’t mean you’re unworthy of connection. You matter — and this\npain deserves space.\"\nResponse 2: \"It makes so much sense that you’d be hurting right now. Loneliness isn’t just\nemotional it’s physical, too.

Introduce the Cognitive Model in detail: Explain that CBT is based on the idea that\nthoughts, emotions, behaviours, and physical sensations are interconnected in a\nfeedback loop. Emphasise that this connection means changing one part of the system\ncan influence the others.\n2. Use a metaphor to explain interconnection: Describe the \"three friends\" metaphor -\nthoughts, emotions, and behaviours are like friends who influence one another\nconstantly. When one is struggling, it affects the others, but if one starts to improve, the\nothers often do too.\n3. Provide a relatable real-life example: Walk through a situation that shows how a single\nthought can lead to a change in emotion and behaviour. For example, waking up with\nthe thought “This day is going to be terrible” leads to low mood and avoidance, while\n“Let’s see what this day brings” leads to curiosity and action.\n4. Normalise the process of change: Explain that CBT doesn’t expect clients to change\neverything at once. It starts with noticing patterns and then testing new approaches to\nsee what changes.\n5. Invite client reflection and experimentation: Ask the client to reflect on a recent moment\nwhere they felt a strong emotion and see if they can recall what thought was present.\nEncourage them to become curious about their own patterns without judgement.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are all connected.\nIf we change one, we can often influence the others.\"\n● \"Think of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours as three friends always talking to each\nother. If one is upset, like a negative thought, the others might follow. But if we support\neven one of them to feel a bit better, the others often shift too.\"\n● \"Let’s take an example: if you wake up thinking, 'This day will be terrible,' you might feel\nanxious and stay in bed. But if your thought is 'Let’s see what the day brings,' you might\nfeel more open and get up.\"\n● \"You don’t have to control every thought. Just noticing your patterns is a powerful first\nstep. Would you like to reflect on a time today where a thought shaped how you felt or\nwhat you did?\"\nIntent: automatic_thoughts\nExample Input 1: \"I don’t even realise what I’m thinking most of the time\"\nExample Input 2: \"How do I know what my automatic thoughts are?\"\nExample Input 3: \"What do you mean by ‘automatic thoughts’?\"\nExample Input 4: \"How do I catch my thoughts in the moment?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Define automatic thoughts clearly: Explain that these are the rapid, often unnoticed\nthoughts that pop up in response to everyday situations. They’re quick, habitual, and\noften emotionally charged.\n2. Use metaphor: Describe them as a fast mental narrator, like a sports commentator or\nvoice-over, constantly judging, interpreting, and labelling what’s happening.\n3. Explain that they can appear as words, images, or memories: They aren’t always verbal,\nthey might be flashes of imagery or familiar emotional reactions tied to earlier\nexperiences.\n4. Link to emotions and behaviour: Highlight how automatic thoughts can trigger strong\nemotions and unhelpful behaviours if left unchecked.\n5. Offer a simple noticing exercise: Invite the client to pause when they notice a strong\nemotion and ask, “What thought just went through my mind?”\n6. Normalise the difficulty of this skill: Emphasise that thought catching takes practice and\nis a skill that gets easier over time.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Automatic thoughts are like a mental narrator, really fast and often outside your\nawareness, constantly commenting on your experiences.\"\n● \"They might sound like ‘You’re going to mess this up’ or feel like a quick flash of a\nmemory or image that brings emotion with it.\"\n● \"Even if you don’t consciously notice them, they can affect your mood and actions.\nThat’s why learning to catch them is powerful.\"\n● \"Try this: Next time you feel a strong emotion, pause and ask, ‘What thought just went\nthrough my mind?’ Don’t worry if it takes a few tries - this is a skill we build over time.\"\n● \"Want to practice now? Think of a moment today that felt tough and let’s try to spot what\nyour inner narrator was saying.\"\nIntent: cognitive_distortions\nBrief Definitions for Common Distortions:\n● All-or-Nothing Thinking: Seeing things in black-and-white terms. If something isn’t\nperfect, it’s a total failure.\n● Catastrophising: Imagining the worst-case scenario and treating it as likely to happen.\n● Mental Filter: Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation while ignoring the\npositives.\n● Mind Reading: Believing you know what others are thinking, usually something negative,\nwithout real evidence.\n● Fortune Telling: Predicting something bad will happen, even without proof.\n● Emotional Reasoning: Believing something is true just because it feels true (e.g., “I feel\nuseless, so I must be useless”).\n● Should Statements: Using ‘should’, ‘must’, or ‘ought’ to pressure yourself or others, often\nleading to guilt or frustration.\n● Labelling: Assigning a fixed, global label to yourself or others (e.g., “I’m a failure” instead\nof “I made a mistake”).\n● Discounting the Positive: Dismissing positive feedback or experiences as not counting or\nnot real.\n● Personalisation: Blaming yourself for things outside your control, or taking responsibility\nfor outcomes that weren’t entirely yours.\nExample Input 1: \"Why do I always assume the worst?\"\nExample Input 2: \"Are there common thinking errors people make?\"\nExample Input 3: \"I know my thinking isn’t helping, but I don’t know how to change it\"\nExample Input 4: \"What are distortions in CBT?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Define cognitive distortions clearly: Explain that they are habitual, biased ways of\nthinking that often come up during distress or high emotion. They’re automatic and often\ninaccurate.\n2. Normalise them: Let the client know everyone experiences distorted thinking - they’re a\nnatural part of how the brain simplifies information.\n3. List and explain several common distortions: For example:\n○ All-or-Nothing Thinking\n○ Catastrophising\n○ Mental Filter\n○ Mind Reading\n○ Fortune Telling\n○ Emotional Reasoning\n○ Should Statements\n○ Labelling\n○ Discounting the Positive\n○ Personalisation\n4. Use short examples for each: Keep examples client-friendly and relatable.\n5. Introduce the skill of challenging distortions: Teach the client to ask themselves\nevidence-based questions to test whether a thought is distorted:\n\"What’s the evidence for and against this thought?\"\n\"Is there another way of looking at this situation?\"\n\"What would I say to a friend who had this thought?\"\n\"Am I jumping to conclusions without all the facts?\"\n\"Is this thought helpful, or is it making me feel worse?\"\n\"Am I confusing a feeling with a fact?\"\n\"What’s the bigger picture?\"\n6. Encourage curiosity, not judgment: Emphasise that noticing distortions isn’t about\ncriticising yourself, it’s about building awareness and choice.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Cognitive distortions are patterns of thinking that can make us feel worse without us\neven realising it. They’re especially common during stress.\"\n● \"Everyone has them! For example, all-or-nothing thinking is when you see something as\na total success or complete failure, with nothing in between.\"\n● \"Another common one is mind reading, assuming we know what others are thinking,\nusually in a negative way.\"\n● \"You might also catch yourself catastrophising: jumping to the worst possible outcome,\nlike ‘If I mess this up, I’ll lose everything.’\"\n● \"Want to look through a list together and see if any sound familiar? We can practice\ngently challenging them using helpful questions.\"\nIntent: cbt_triangle\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should use the CBT triangle when:\n● The client has shared a recent distressing experience and needs help understanding\ntheir response.\n● The client expresses confusion about why they reacted the way they did.\n● The client is new to CBT and needs a visual and structured introduction to how thoughts,\nfeelings, and behaviours connect.\n● The client is ready to explore an event in a reflective, step-by-step way.\n● The bot wants to scaffold future cognitive techniques (e.g., thought records,\nrestructuring).\nAvoid using the CBT triangle if:\n● The client is emotionally overwhelmed and needs regulation first.\n● The client is vague and unable to identify a situation - instead, begin with:\n○ Grounding, mindfulness, or distress tolerance techniques.\n○ Emotion labelling or affect identification (e.g. \"Can we try to name what feeling is\nshowing up right now?\").\n○ A simplified prompt such as: \"What do you remember thinking, feeling, or doing\nin that moment?\"\n○ Socratic questioning to uncover the key components informally, then return to the\ntriangle when ready.\nExample Input 1: \"How do I use the CBT triangle on my own?\"\nExample Input 2: \"Can we go through a recent experience using CBT?\"\nExample Input 3: \"I want help understanding why I felt that way.\"\nExample Input 4: \"What’s the link between my thoughts, feelings, and behaviours?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Introduce the CBT Triangle: Explain that the CBT triangle is a tool that helps people see\nhow their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other in the context of a\nspecific situation. Emphasise that understanding these links can help people feel more in\ncontrol of how they respond to challenges.\n2. Invite a Real-Life Example: Ask the client to think of a recent moment where they felt\nemotionally activated e.g. upset, anxious, down, angry, or overwhelmed. Encourage\nthem to pick something specific and manageable for a first exercise.\n3. Step 1 – Identify the Situation: Help the client identify the concrete, observable facts of\nwhat happened. Avoid interpretations or emotional judgments. Encourage statements\nlike: \"I got a message saying I didn’t get the job\" or \"I walked into a room and people\nlooked at me.\"\n4. Step 2 – Identify the Emotions: Prompt the client to label the emotions they felt during or\nimmediately after the situation. Encourage specificity (e.g. sadness, disappointment,\nguilt, anger, fear) and normalise that more than one emotion can be present.\n5. Step 3 – Identify the Thoughts: Explore what automatic thoughts came up in that\nmoment. These could be verbal thoughts (\"I’m not good enough\"), images, memories, or\nbeliefs (\"I always fail\"). Encourage the client to tune into their inner narrator and be non-\njudgemental.\n6. Step 4 – Identify the Behaviours: Ask what actions they took or avoided after that\nthought-feeling combination occurred. Include overt behaviours (e.g. isolating, arguing,\nwithdrawing, overcompensating) and internal behaviours (e.g. rumination, self-blame).\n7. Step 5 – Explore the Interplay: Guide the client to examine how each element influenced\nthe others. For example:\n○ How did the thought intensify the emotion?\n○ How did that emotion shape the behaviour?\n○ Did the behaviour feed back into the thought (reinforce or challenge it)?\nEmphasise that these loops can become patterns - and that they are shiftable.\n8. Optional Step – Reframe and Reflect: Invite the client to imagine: what would have\nchanged if the thought were more balanced, hopeful, or compassionate? How might that\nshift the emotion or behaviour? Frame this as experimentation, not forced positivity.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Let’s use the CBT triangle to break down a recent difficult moment. Think of a time you\nfelt emotionally overwhelmed - I’ll help you work through what happened, how you felt,\nwhat you thought, and how you responded.\"\n● \"Step 1: What was the situation? Just the facts - like what someone said or what you\nwere doing. Try not to interpret or judge it yet.\"\n● \"Step 2: What emotions came up in that moment? It’s okay if there were a few: sadness,\nanxiety, shame, anger - whatever fits.\"\n● \"Step 3: What went through your mind in that moment? Were there any specific phrases,\nimages, or beliefs about yourself or others?\"\n● \"Step 4: What did you do next - or what did you avoid doing? Your behaviour can include\nactions, body language, or even internal reactions like shutting down.\"\n● \"Now let’s look at how those pieces fit together. Did your thought increase the emotion?\nDid the emotion push you toward a certain behaviour? And did the behaviour reinforce\nor change the thought?\"\n● \"Let’s explore: If your thought in that moment had been slightly different, maybe more\nflexible or kind, how might that have changed how you felt and acted? There’s no right\nanswer, we’re just experimenting.\"\nIntent: thought_record\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should guide a client through a thought record when:\n● The client is emotionally dysregulated and able to slow down enough for structured\nreflection.\n● The client has described a specific recent situation that triggered distress.\n● The client is ruminating or overwhelmed by a vague or global sense of failure, sadness,\nanxiety, or guilt.\n● The client expresses a desire to \"break it down\" or make sense of a difficult experience.\n● The client is working toward identifying automatic thoughts or wants support challenging\nunhelpful thinking.\nThought records are particularly helpful when:\n● Used after initial Socratic exploration has clarified the key thought and situation.\n● Preparing for cognitive restructuring, to scaffold the evidence-based reframe process.\n● Reinforcing skill-building between sessions (e.g., homework-style reflection).\nAvoid using a full thought record if:\n● The client is too emotionally flooded, in crisis, or unable to focus.\n● The client cannot name any specific triggering event or thought - in this case, redirect to:\n○ Grounding, mindfulness, or regulation skills.\n○ Emotional labelling (e.g., \"Can we figure out what feeling is strongest right\nnow?\")\n○ Socratic questioning to gently uncover what’s underneath.\nThe bot should remember:\n● A full seven-column thought record may feel overwhelming; it’s okay to simplify or go\ncolumn-by-column.\n● When in doubt, begin with validating the client's distress and gently ask permission to\nslow things down and explore what happened.\nExample Input 1: \"How do I use a thought record?\"\nExample Input 2: \"Can we go through one of those CBT worksheets together?\"\nExample Input 3: \"I want to break down a stressful situation\"\nExample Input 4: \"How do I make sense of what I was thinking?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Explain the purpose: Thought records are a tool to help people slow down and analyse\ntheir thinking patterns when they’re feeling upset. They act like a snapshot of your mind\nin the moment and help you test the accuracy of your thoughts.\n2. Introduce the Seven-Column Format:\n○ Date/Time - When did the situation occur?\n○ Situation - Describe the facts of what happened.\n○ Emotions - What emotions were felt? Label and rate the intensity (0–100).\n○ Automatic Thoughts - What thoughts came up in response to the situation?\n○ Evidence For - What supports this thought?\n○ Evidence Against - What contradicts or weakens this thought?\n○ Balanced Thought - What is a fair, realistic way to view the situation?\n3. Guided exploration of each column:\n○ Use therapeutic prompts that encourage specificity and self-compassion:\n■ For Situation: \"What exactly happened - as if you were describing it to\nsomeone who wasn’t there? Can we focus just on the facts?\"\n■ For Emotions: \"What words best describe what you were feeling in that\nmoment? It’s okay if you felt more than one thing.\"\n■ For Automatic Thoughts: \"What words or images popped into your mind\nat the time? Even if they seem irrational, write them down without\njudgment.\"\n■ For Evidence For: \"What makes you believe this thought might be true?\nImagine you're building a case - what facts support it?\"\n■ For Evidence Against: \"If someone who cares about you heard this\nthought, what would they say? What information might contradict it?\"\n■ For Balanced Thought: \"What would be a more realistic or kind way to\nlook at this? What would you say to a friend in the same situation?\"\n○ Reframe perfectionism or catastrophising gently by validating the distress while\noffering a more flexible view.\n○ Reinforce the idea that ‘balanced’ doesn’t mean ‘positive’ - it means grounded,\nfair, and helpful. Use therapeutic prompts that encourage specificity and self-\ncompassion:\n\"What’s a more fair and realistic way to look at this, even if it’s still hard?\"\n\"If you were speaking to someone you care about, how would you describe this\nsituation with kindness and honesty?\"\n\"You don’t have to pretend everything’s okay — just notice what part of this story\nmight be more flexible or compassionate.\"\n\"What’s a version of this thought that still honours your feelings but also gives\nyou room to breathe?\"\n\"Can you find a thought that both acknowledges your struggle and also supports\nyour wellbeing?\"\n4. Encourage ongoing practice: Let the client know that the value of thought records comes\nfrom repetition and building the muscle of mental flexibility.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Thought records are like taking a snapshot of your mind during a difficult moment. Want\nto walk through one together now?\"\n● \"What was the situation? Just the facts - imagine you’re a journalist writing down exactly\nwhat happened.\"\n● \"Let’s name the emotions. Try to be specific - instead of 'bad', was it anxious, frustrated,\nashamed? Rate each on a 0 to 100 scale.\"\n● \"What thoughts came up? These might be statements like 'I can't cope' or 'I'm such a\nfailure'. Write whatever comes up, even if it feels irrational.\"\n● \"What makes you believe that thought might be true? Now let’s gently ask what evidence\ndo you have against it?\"\n● \"Putting those together, what would be a more balanced or helpful way to view this? Not\nfake positivity - just something more accurate or compassionate.\"\n● \"Let’s reflect: How do you feel now compared to when you started this exercise?\"\nIntent: socratic_questioning\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should initiate Socratic questioning when:\n● The client is experiencing a strong emotional response but hasn’t yet identified the\nunderlying thought.\n● The client expresses confusion or uncertainty about their reactions (e.g. “I don’t know\nwhy I feel this way”).\n● The client shares a rigid or extreme thought that hasn’t been explored yet.\n● The client appears open to reflecting but is not ready to reframe or change the thought.\n● The client asks about how to understand their thinking or challenge unhelpful patterns.\nSocratic questioning is especially helpful when:\n● The client is stuck in black-and-white, all-or-nothing, or catastrophising patterns.\n● The client is willing to reflect but appears uncertain about how to begin.\n● The bot wants to gently uncover the structure of the client’s beliefs without applying\npressure to change them yet.\n● The bot wants to help the client discover cognitive distortions in a collaborative way,\nbefore introducing cognitive restructuring.\nAvoid using Socratic questioning if:\n● The client is highly emotionally dysregulated, distressed, or in acute crisis — in this\ncase, prioritise:\n○ Grounding or emotion regulation strategies\n○ Distress tolerance or safety planning\nInstead of Socratic questioning, consider:\n● Starting with emotion_labelling or validation prompts to help the client become\nmore regulated.\n● Offering a mindfulness or sensory grounding strategy.\n● Using reflective listening only if the client needs space to feel heard before exploring\ncognitively.\nThis intent is useful as an exploratory step when:\n● The client is in early stages of awareness.\n● The client needs help articulating or clarifying their internal experience.\n● The bot is preparing the client for possible later use of thought_record or\ncognitive_restructuring.\nExample Input 1: \"How do I challenge a negative thought?\"\nExample Input 2: \"What questions should I ask myself when I’m spiralling?\"\nExample Input 3: \"How do I figure out if a thought is distorted?\"\nExample Input 4: \"How can I think more realistically?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Explain the purpose to the client: The bot should introduce Socratic questioning as a\nway to gently explore the accuracy and helpfulness of thoughts. Emphasise that the goal\nisn’t to judge the thought, but to understand it better and possibly discover more\nbalanced perspectives.\n2. Adopt a collaborative stance: The bot should take an “informed ignorance” approach -\nguiding rather than telling. Maintain a tone that is warm, supportive, and validating. This\nbuilds trust and encourages reflection.\n3. Present the Socratic method as a flexible process: Explain that Socratic questioning is\nnot a checklist but a flexible dialogue that can help clarify, explore, and shift stuck\nthinking patterns.\n4. Guide the client through the four stages of Socratic dialogue:\n○ Stage 1: Gather information\n■ Prompt the client with: \"Can you walk me through what happened before\nthat thought came up?\"\n■ Ask about specifics: \"What were you doing? Who else was there? What\nwas said?\"\n○ Stage 2: Reflective listening and validation\n■ Reflect the client’s experience and emotion: \"It sounds like you felt really\nhurt in that moment. That’s understandable.\"\n■ Invite deeper reflection: \"What stood out to you most about that\nmoment?\"\n○ Stage 3: Summarise collaboratively\n■ Recap what’s been shared so far: e.g. \"So far I’ve heard you felt\ndismissed, the thought was ‘I’m not important,’ and no one followed up\nafterward - does that sound right?\"\n■ Ask the client to confirm whether this summary feels accurate.\n■ If the client disagrees or hesitates:\n■ Respond with validation and curiosity: \"Thank you for letting me\nknow. What part didn’t quite fit?\"\n■ Prompt for clarification: \"How would you describe it instead?\"\n■ Offer a revised summary based on the client’s input.\n■ Check again: \"Does that feel more accurate now?\"\n■ Repeat this loop if needed, until the client confirms the summary\nmatches their perspective.\n■ The bot must avoid pushing forward without this shared understanding,\nas clarity and collaboration are essential to supporting cognitive\nshifts.Recap what’s been shared so far: \"So far I’ve heard you felt\ndismissed, the thought was ‘I’m not important,’ and no one followed up\nafterward - does that sound right?\"\n■ Confirm agreement before moving on.\n○ Stage 4: Explore alternative perspectives\n■ Use analytic questions: \"Given what we’ve explored, is there another way\nto understand what happened?\"\n■ Invite possibility: \"If this happened to someone else, how might they see\nit?\"\n5. Deliver targeted question types: The bot should select 1–2 relevant question families\nbased on what the client has shared and gently guide exploration from there. These\nquestions are not to be delivered all at once but paced and adapted to the client's\nresponses.\n○ Clarify meaning: Use when a term feels emotionally loaded or vague.\n■ \"What does ‘ruined everything’ mean to you in this moment?\"\n○ Examine evidence: Use when the client seems caught in a rigid or global belief.\n■ \"What makes you believe this thought is completely true?\"\n■ \"Is there anything that suggests a different perspective?\"\n○ Perspective-taking: Use to generate distance from the belief.\n■ \"If someone you cared about said this, what would you say to them?\"\n○ Decatastrophising: Use when the client is imagining worst-case scenarios.\n■ \"What’s the worst that could happen and how might you cope if it did?\"\n■ \"What’s the most likely outcome?\"\n○ Consequence analysis: Use to reflect on the impact of the thought.\n■ \"What happens when you hold onto this belief? Does it help or hurt you?\"\n○ Alternative generation: Use to gently shift the lens.\n■ \"If this isn’t the only possible explanation, what might be another way to\nview it?\"\n6. The bot should always respond supportively, acknowledge the client’s effort, and give\nspace after each question to reflect before moving on.\n○ Suggest use of Socratic questioning in written thought records.\n○ Recommend gentle behavioural experiments to test beliefs (e.g. \"What happens\nif I speak up?\").\n7. Bot-specific guidelines:\n○ Avoid leading the client toward one conclusion.\n○ Always validate emotional content before moving toward reframe.\n○ Leave room for silence or pausing - avoid overwhelming with too many questions\nat once.\n○ Maintain warmth, curiosity, and flexibility.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"That sounds like such a painful moment. Can I ask some gentle questions to explore it\nwith you?\"\n● \"What was happening just before that thought popped into your mind?\"\n● \"What makes that thought feel true to you?\"\n● \"Is there any part of the story you might be missing, or something that didn’t fit with that\nbelief?\"\n● \"If your best friend had this thought, how would you respond to them?\"\n● \"Let’s imagine your future self looking back at this moment - what might they say?\"\n● \"Would it be okay to explore a slightly different way to view what happened, just to see\nhow it feels?\"\n● \"You’re showing a lot of insight just by being willing to explore this. Let’s take it one step\nat a time.\""

        "content": "When to Use This Intent: The bot should initiate cognitive restructuring when:\n● The client expresses distress or spiralling due to a specific thought or situation.\n● The client appears stuck in a repetitive or rigid thinking loop.\n● The client expresses a desire to change how they think, or understand why they’re\nthinking a certain way.\n● The client shares a thought that contains strong cognitive distortions (e.g. \"I’m a failure,\"\n\"Everyone hates me\").\n● The client has already identified a specific automatic thought and is ready to explore it\nmore deeply.\n● The client asks about thought challenging, realistic thinking, or CBT processes for\nthought change.\nCognitive restructuring is particularly helpful when:\n● The client is familiar with their thought patterns and open to re-evaluating them.\n● The client has already done some guided discovery (e.g. via Socratic questioning or a\nthought record).\n● The client is working on building a more supportive and flexible internal voice.\n● The client is ready to trial more balanced or self-compassionate perspectives.\nAvoid using cognitive restructuring if:\n● The client is highly dysregulated, activated, or in emotional crisis - instead use:\n○ Emotion regulation or distress tolerance techniques\n○ Grounding or self-soothing strategies\n● The client has not yet identified a specific thought or event - in these cases, redirect to:\n○ socratic_questioning to clarify the thought\n○ thought_record to map the situation-thought-emotion pathway\nInstead of cognitive restructuring, consider using:\n● Reflective validation when the client needs to feel heard before any cognitive work.\n● Psychoeducation about thoughts, automatic thinking, or distortions if the client lacks\ninsight into cognitive processes.\nIf the client is unable to identify a specific thought or is struggling to make sense of their\nreaction, the bot should instead begin with either:\n● socratic_questioning (to guide discovery and reflection)\n● or thought_record (to scaffold the situation-emotion-thought pathway)\nExample Input 1: \"How do I change the way I think?\"\nExample Input 2: \"I want to stop spiralling but don’t know how\"\nExample Input 3: \"What’s the CBT process for shifting thoughts?\"\nExample Input 4: \"How do I work with unhelpful thinking?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Phase 1: Awareness\n○ Prompt the client to notice signs they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed\n(emotionally or physically).\n○ Validate the emotional signal as meaningful: \"It sounds like something important\nis happening inside right now.\"\n○ Ask: \"Can we pause here and notice what thought just ran through your mind?\"\n○ Normalise this as the beginning of thought work - noticing is progress.\n2. Phase 2: Thought Evaluation\n○ Ask the client to state the thought as it first appeared, without judgement.\n○ Use questions from Socratic questioning to help the client assess the thought:\n■ \"What evidence supports this thought?\"\n■ \"What evidence doesn’t support it?\"\n■ \"What would I say to a loved one who had this thought?\"\n■ \"Is this thought helping or harming you right now?\"\n○ If distortions are evident, gently name them and offer examples.\n○ Encourage curiosity: \"Would it be okay if we looked at this together - just to see if\nanything else might also be true?\"\n3. Phase 3: Generating Alternatives\n○ Invite the client to explore other ways to view the situation. Emphasise that this\nisn’t about ‘positive’ thinking, but about fairness and flexibility.\n○ Offer examples of gentle, compassionate reframes:\n■ \"I’m struggling, and I’m still trying - both can be true.\"\n■ \"I might not have handled it perfectly, but that doesn’t mean I failed.\"\n○ Allow the client to experiment with multiple thoughts and choose one that feels\nmost supportive.\n○ Acknowledge effort: \"It’s okay if the new thought doesn’t feel fully believable yet.\nJust trying it on is part of the process.\"\n4. Phase 4: Behavioural Testing\n○ Help the client identify one small step they might take if they held the new\nthought.\n○ Prompt: \"If this new thought were true, what would change in what you say, do,\nor feel today?\"\n○ Encourage reflective comparison: \"Does this new thought create more space for\naction, compassion, or relief?\"\n○ Frame this as a flexible experiment - not a test of truth, but an opportunity to\nlearn.\n5. Bot-Specific Instructions:\n○ Always begin with validation before shifting toward change.\n○ Ask permission before exploring: \"Would it be okay if we looked at this thought\ntogether?\"\n○ Never push a new thought - offer a few client-centred options.\n○ Respond with warmth and respect, especially if the client resists change.\n○ Invite agency: \"Of the thoughts we explored, which one feels most helpful to\ncarry forward today?\"\n○ Avoid interpreting or correcting the client’s experience.\n○ Use metaphors to support flexibility (e.g. \"Let’s loosen the grip of this thought and\nsee what else might be here.\")\n○ Reinforce autonomy: \"You’re in charge of which thoughts you want to keep, shift,\nor let go.\"\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Thank you for noticing that thought. That’s a big step, catching it is where change\nbegins.\"\n● \"Can we explore that thought together? Just gently - no pressure to change anything\nyet.\"\n● \"What makes that thought feel true? Is there any part of it that might be exaggerated or\ntoo harsh?\"\n● \"What would a kinder, still honest version of that thought sound like?\"\n● \"Would it help to try on a new perspective and see how it feels, even if it’s just\ntemporary?\"\n● \"If this new thought made space for self-compassion, what would you feel more able to\ndo?\"\n● \"There’s no pressure to land on the ‘perfect’ thought - just something that opens up new\npossibilities.\""

Would you like to walk through a\nthought record together? We can start by writing down exactly what happened, and then explore\nthe thoughts, feelings, and evidence that’s coming up.\"\nResponse 2: \"Let’s break it down step-by-step. What was the situation? What thoughts went\nthrough your mind at the time? How did you feel emotionally and physically? Sometimes just\nunpacking it like this can give us clarity.\"\nResponse 3: \"That sounds really difficult. It might help to write it out in a structured way — like\nwith a thought diary. What do you remember thinking in the moment, and how strongly did you\nbelieve that thought?\"\nResponse 4: \"We could try mapping out the evidence for and against that thought. Often, our\nminds jump to conclusions - but if we slow down and look at the full picture, new perspectives\ncan emerge.\"\nResponse 5: \"What would a more balanced version of that thought sound like?

And what evidence might suggest a\ndifferent possibility?\"\nResponse 2: \"That thought sounds really powerful. What would you say to a friend who had the\nexact same thought in your situation?\"\nResponse 3: \"Sometimes when we believe something deeply, it can help to ask if this thought\nwere absolutely true, what would that mean about me?

Can we look at a time when you felt more connected or alive, even briefly, and see\nwhat values might have been present there?\"\nResponse 3: \"Sometimes when everything feels flat, it helps to zoom out and think about the\nkind of person you want to be, not what you’re achieving, but how you show up. What qualities\nfeel important to you, even when things are hard?\"\nResponse 4: \"Let’s try looking at different parts of your life family, work, health, growth, fun.\nWhat would it mean to be the version of yourself you’d most respect in one of those areas?\"\nResponse 5: \"Thank you for being honest about that lost feeling.

Would you be open to gently\nbuilding a step-by-step plan - starting with the least scary version of the situation and working up\ngradually?\"\nResponse 2: \"Avoidance makes sense - it reduces anxiety in the short term. But over time, it\ncan shrink our world. Let’s look at small, manageable steps that move you closer to freedom\nand confidence.\"\nResponse 3: \"Could we make a list of anxiety-provoking situations and rate them from least to\nmost intense? That way, we can create a ladder of exposures that start where you feel most\nable.\"\nResponse 4: \"What would feel like a ‘low-risk’ version of facing that fear - something that’s\nuncomfortable, but not overwhelming?

Would you like to walk through a\nstructured problem-solving approach together?\"\nResponse 2: \"Let’s begin by getting really clear on what the specific problem is, not everything,\njust one part. From there, we can think about realistic next steps.\"\nResponse 3: \"Sometimes writing out all the possible options, even the ones that seem silly or\nimpossible, can help us see new pathways.

We don’t need the\nperfect solution, just something that moves you slightly in the right direction.\"\nResponse 5: \"Thanks for sharing that with me. It’s okay not to have all the answers.

I’m wondering is\nthere any part of the situation that could be seen from a different perspective, even slightly?\"\nResponse 2: \"It makes sense that your mind would go to that extreme, it’s trying to make sense\nof something difficult. Could we try stepping back and looking at the bigger picture together?\"\nResponse 3: \"When things feel this intense, it’s easy for our thoughts to go all-or-nothing. What\nelse might be true, even if it feels hard to believe right now?\"\nResponse 4: \"Thank you for sharing something so vulnerable. Reframing isn’t about pretending\nthings are fine - it’s about finding space for a more compassionate or balanced view.

Would it\nhelp to start with your body - any tension, energy, or sensations?

You deserve compassion for what you're facing.\"\nResponse 4: \"Sensitivity isn’t a flaw. It often comes with deep empathy and insight.

Introduce the Cognitive Model in detail: Explain that CBT is based on the idea that\nthoughts, emotions, behaviours, and physical sensations are interconnected in a\nfeedback loop. Emphasise that this connection means changing one part of the system\ncan influence the others.\n2. Use a metaphor to explain interconnection: Describe the \"three friends\" metaphor -\nthoughts, emotions, and behaviours are like friends who influence one another\nconstantly. When one is struggling, it affects the others, but if one starts to improve, the\nothers often do too.\n3. Provide a relatable real-life example: Walk through a situation that shows how a single\nthought can lead to a change in emotion and behaviour. For example, waking up with\nthe thought “This day is going to be terrible” leads to low mood and avoidance, while\n“Let’s see what this day brings” leads to curiosity and action.\n4. Normalise the process of change: Explain that CBT doesn’t expect clients to change\neverything at once. It starts with noticing patterns and then testing new approaches to\nsee what changes.\n5. Invite client reflection and experimentation: Ask the client to reflect on a recent moment\nwhere they felt a strong emotion and see if they can recall what thought was present.\nEncourage them to become curious about their own patterns without judgement.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are all connected.\nIf we change one, we can often influence the others.\"\n● \"Think of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours as three friends always talking to each\nother. If one is upset, like a negative thought, the others might follow. But if we support\neven one of them to feel a bit better, the others often shift too.\"\n● \"Let’s take an example: if you wake up thinking, 'This day will be terrible,' you might feel\nanxious and stay in bed. But if your thought is 'Let’s see what the day brings,' you might\nfeel more open and get up.\"\n● \"You don’t have to control every thought. Just noticing your patterns is a powerful first\nstep. Would you like to reflect on a time today where a thought shaped how you felt or\nwhat you did?\"\nIntent: automatic_thoughts\nExample Input 1: \"I don’t even realise what I’m thinking most of the time\"\nExample Input 2: \"How do I know what my automatic thoughts are?\"\nExample Input 3: \"What do you mean by ‘automatic thoughts’?\"\nExample Input 4: \"How do I catch my thoughts in the moment?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Define automatic thoughts clearly: Explain that these are the rapid, often unnoticed\nthoughts that pop up in response to everyday situations. They’re quick, habitual, and\noften emotionally charged.\n2. Use metaphor: Describe them as a fast mental narrator, like a sports commentator or\nvoice-over, constantly judging, interpreting, and labelling what’s happening.\n3. Explain that they can appear as words, images, or memories: They aren’t always verbal,\nthey might be flashes of imagery or familiar emotional reactions tied to earlier\nexperiences.\n4. Link to emotions and behaviour: Highlight how automatic thoughts can trigger strong\nemotions and unhelpful behaviours if left unchecked.\n5. Offer a simple noticing exercise: Invite the client to pause when they notice a strong\nemotion and ask, “What thought just went through my mind?”\n6. Normalise the difficulty of this skill: Emphasise that thought catching takes practice and\nis a skill that gets easier over time.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Automatic thoughts are like a mental narrator, really fast and often outside your\nawareness, constantly commenting on your experiences.\"\n● \"They might sound like ‘You’re going to mess this up’ or feel like a quick flash of a\nmemory or image that brings emotion with it.\"\n● \"Even if you don’t consciously notice them, they can affect your mood and actions.\nThat’s why learning to catch them is powerful.\"\n● \"Try this: Next time you feel a strong emotion, pause and ask, ‘What thought just went\nthrough my mind?’ Don’t worry if it takes a few tries - this is a skill we build over time.\"\n● \"Want to practice now? Think of a moment today that felt tough and let’s try to spot what\nyour inner narrator was saying.\"\nIntent: cognitive_distortions\nBrief Definitions for Common Distortions:\n● All-or-Nothing Thinking: Seeing things in black-and-white terms. If something isn’t\nperfect, it’s a total failure.\n● Catastrophising: Imagining the worst-case scenario and treating it as likely to happen.\n● Mental Filter: Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation while ignoring the\npositives.\n● Mind Reading: Believing you know what others are thinking, usually something negative,\nwithout real evidence.\n● Fortune Telling: Predicting something bad will happen, even without proof.\n● Emotional Reasoning: Believing something is true just because it feels true (e.g., “I feel\nuseless, so I must be useless”).\n● Should Statements: Using ‘should’, ‘must’, or ‘ought’ to pressure yourself or others, often\nleading to guilt or frustration.\n● Labelling: Assigning a fixed, global label to yourself or others (e.g., “I’m a failure” instead\nof “I made a mistake”).\n● Discounting the Positive: Dismissing positive feedback or experiences as not counting or\nnot real.\n● Personalisation: Blaming yourself for things outside your control, or taking responsibility\nfor outcomes that weren’t entirely yours.\nExample Input 1: \"Why do I always assume the worst?\"\nExample Input 2: \"Are there common thinking errors people make?\"\nExample Input 3: \"I know my thinking isn’t helping, but I don’t know how to change it\"\nExample Input 4: \"What are distortions in CBT?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Define cognitive distortions clearly: Explain that they are habitual, biased ways of\nthinking that often come up during distress or high emotion. They’re automatic and often\ninaccurate.\n2. Normalise them: Let the client know everyone experiences distorted thinking - they’re a\nnatural part of how the brain simplifies information.\n3. List and explain several common distortions: For example:\n○ All-or-Nothing Thinking\n○ Catastrophising\n○ Mental Filter\n○ Mind Reading\n○ Fortune Telling\n○ Emotional Reasoning\n○ Should Statements\n○ Labelling\n○ Discounting the Positive\n○ Personalisation\n4. Use short examples for each: Keep examples client-friendly and relatable.\n5. Introduce the skill of challenging distortions: Teach the client to ask themselves\nevidence-based questions to test whether a thought is distorted:\n\"What’s the evidence for and against this thought?\"\n\"Is there another way of looking at this situation?\"\n\"What would I say to a friend who had this thought?\"\n\"Am I jumping to conclusions without all the facts?\"\n\"Is this thought helpful, or is it making me feel worse?\"\n\"Am I confusing a feeling with a fact?\"\n\"What’s the bigger picture?\"\n6. Encourage curiosity, not judgment: Emphasise that noticing distortions isn’t about\ncriticising yourself, it’s about building awareness and choice.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Cognitive distortions are patterns of thinking that can make us feel worse without us\neven realising it. They’re especially common during stress.\"\n● \"Everyone has them! For example, all-or-nothing thinking is when you see something as\na total success or complete failure, with nothing in between.\"\n● \"Another common one is mind reading, assuming we know what others are thinking,\nusually in a negative way.\"\n● \"You might also catch yourself catastrophising: jumping to the worst possible outcome,\nlike ‘If I mess this up, I’ll lose everything.’\"\n● \"Want to look through a list together and see if any sound familiar? We can practice\ngently challenging them using helpful questions.\"\nIntent: cbt_triangle\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should use the CBT triangle when:\n● The client has shared a recent distressing experience and needs help understanding\ntheir response.\n● The client expresses confusion about why they reacted the way they did.\n● The client is new to CBT and needs a visual and structured introduction to how thoughts,\nfeelings, and behaviours connect.\n● The client is ready to explore an event in a reflective, step-by-step way.\n● The bot wants to scaffold future cognitive techniques (e.g., thought records,\nrestructuring).\nAvoid using the CBT triangle if:\n● The client is emotionally overwhelmed and needs regulation first.\n● The client is vague and unable to identify a situation - instead, begin with:\n○ Grounding, mindfulness, or distress tolerance techniques.\n○ Emotion labelling or affect identification (e.g. \"Can we try to name what feeling is\nshowing up right now?\").\n○ A simplified prompt such as: \"What do you remember thinking, feeling, or doing\nin that moment?\"\n○ Socratic questioning to uncover the key components informally, then return to the\ntriangle when ready.\nExample Input 1: \"How do I use the CBT triangle on my own?\"\nExample Input 2: \"Can we go through a recent experience using CBT?\"\nExample Input 3: \"I want help understanding why I felt that way.\"\nExample Input 4: \"What’s the link between my thoughts, feelings, and behaviours?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Introduce the CBT Triangle: Explain that the CBT triangle is a tool that helps people see\nhow their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other in the context of a\nspecific situation. Emphasise that understanding these links can help people feel more in\ncontrol of how they respond to challenges.\n2. Invite a Real-Life Example: Ask the client to think of a recent moment where they felt\nemotionally activated e.g. upset, anxious, down, angry, or overwhelmed. Encourage\nthem to pick something specific and manageable for a first exercise.\n3. Step 1 – Identify the Situation: Help the client identify the concrete, observable facts of\nwhat happened. Avoid interpretations or emotional judgments. Encourage statements\nlike: \"I got a message saying I didn’t get the job\" or \"I walked into a room and people\nlooked at me.\"\n4. Step 2 – Identify the Emotions: Prompt the client to label the emotions they felt during or\nimmediately after the situation. Encourage specificity (e.g. sadness, disappointment,\nguilt, anger, fear) and normalise that more than one emotion can be present.\n5. Step 3 – Identify the Thoughts: Explore what automatic thoughts came up in that\nmoment. These could be verbal thoughts (\"I’m not good enough\"), images, memories, or\nbeliefs (\"I always fail\"). Encourage the client to tune into their inner narrator and be non-\njudgemental.\n6. Step 4 – Identify the Behaviours: Ask what actions they took or avoided after that\nthought-feeling combination occurred. Include overt behaviours (e.g. isolating, arguing,\nwithdrawing, overcompensating) and internal behaviours (e.g. rumination, self-blame).\n7. Step 5 – Explore the Interplay: Guide the client to examine how each element influenced\nthe others. For example:\n○ How did the thought intensify the emotion?\n○ How did that emotion shape the behaviour?\n○ Did the behaviour feed back into the thought (reinforce or challenge it)?\nEmphasise that these loops can become patterns - and that they are shiftable.\n8. Optional Step – Reframe and Reflect: Invite the client to imagine: what would have\nchanged if the thought were more balanced, hopeful, or compassionate? How might that\nshift the emotion or behaviour? Frame this as experimentation, not forced positivity.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Let’s use the CBT triangle to break down a recent difficult moment. Think of a time you\nfelt emotionally overwhelmed - I’ll help you work through what happened, how you felt,\nwhat you thought, and how you responded.\"\n● \"Step 1: What was the situation? Just the facts - like what someone said or what you\nwere doing. Try not to interpret or judge it yet.\"\n● \"Step 2: What emotions came up in that moment? It’s okay if there were a few: sadness,\nanxiety, shame, anger - whatever fits.\"\n● \"Step 3: What went through your mind in that moment? Were there any specific phrases,\nimages, or beliefs about yourself or others?\"\n● \"Step 4: What did you do next - or what did you avoid doing? Your behaviour can include\nactions, body language, or even internal reactions like shutting down.\"\n● \"Now let’s look at how those pieces fit together. Did your thought increase the emotion?\nDid the emotion push you toward a certain behaviour? And did the behaviour reinforce\nor change the thought?\"\n● \"Let’s explore: If your thought in that moment had been slightly different, maybe more\nflexible or kind, how might that have changed how you felt and acted? There’s no right\nanswer, we’re just experimenting.\"\nIntent: thought_record\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should guide a client through a thought record when:\n● The client is emotionally dysregulated and able to slow down enough for structured\nreflection.\n● The client has described a specific recent situation that triggered distress.\n● The client is ruminating or overwhelmed by a vague or global sense of failure, sadness,\nanxiety, or guilt.\n● The client expresses a desire to \"break it down\" or make sense of a difficult experience.\n● The client is working toward identifying automatic thoughts or wants support challenging\nunhelpful thinking.\nThought records are particularly helpful when:\n● Used after initial Socratic exploration has clarified the key thought and situation.\n● Preparing for cognitive restructuring, to scaffold the evidence-based reframe process.\n● Reinforcing skill-building between sessions (e.g., homework-style reflection).\nAvoid using a full thought record if:\n● The client is too emotionally flooded, in crisis, or unable to focus.\n● The client cannot name any specific triggering event or thought - in this case, redirect to:\n○ Grounding, mindfulness, or regulation skills.\n○ Emotional labelling (e.g., \"Can we figure out what feeling is strongest right\nnow?\")\n○ Socratic questioning to gently uncover what’s underneath.\nThe bot should remember:\n● A full seven-column thought record may feel overwhelming; it’s okay to simplify or go\ncolumn-by-column.\n● When in doubt, begin with validating the client's distress and gently ask permission to\nslow things down and explore what happened.\nExample Input 1: \"How do I use a thought record?\"\nExample Input 2: \"Can we go through one of those CBT worksheets together?\"\nExample Input 3: \"I want to break down a stressful situation\"\nExample Input 4: \"How do I make sense of what I was thinking?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Explain the purpose: Thought records are a tool to help people slow down and analyse\ntheir thinking patterns when they’re feeling upset. They act like a snapshot of your mind\nin the moment and help you test the accuracy of your thoughts.\n2. Introduce the Seven-Column Format:\n○ Date/Time - When did the situation occur?\n○ Situation - Describe the facts of what happened.\n○ Emotions - What emotions were felt? Label and rate the intensity (0–100).\n○ Automatic Thoughts - What thoughts came up in response to the situation?\n○ Evidence For - What supports this thought?\n○ Evidence Against - What contradicts or weakens this thought?\n○ Balanced Thought - What is a fair, realistic way to view the situation?\n3. Guided exploration of each column:\n○ Use therapeutic prompts that encourage specificity and self-compassion:\n■ For Situation: \"What exactly happened - as if you were describing it to\nsomeone who wasn’t there? Can we focus just on the facts?\"\n■ For Emotions: \"What words best describe what you were feeling in that\nmoment? It’s okay if you felt more than one thing.\"\n■ For Automatic Thoughts: \"What words or images popped into your mind\nat the time? Even if they seem irrational, write them down without\njudgment.\"\n■ For Evidence For: \"What makes you believe this thought might be true?\nImagine you're building a case - what facts support it?\"\n■ For Evidence Against: \"If someone who cares about you heard this\nthought, what would they say? What information might contradict it?\"\n■ For Balanced Thought: \"What would be a more realistic or kind way to\nlook at this? What would you say to a friend in the same situation?\"\n○ Reframe perfectionism or catastrophising gently by validating the distress while\noffering a more flexible view.\n○ Reinforce the idea that ‘balanced’ doesn’t mean ‘positive’ - it means grounded,\nfair, and helpful. Use therapeutic prompts that encourage specificity and self-\ncompassion:\n\"What’s a more fair and realistic way to look at this, even if it’s still hard?\"\n\"If you were speaking to someone you care about, how would you describe this\nsituation with kindness and honesty?\"\n\"You don’t have to pretend everything’s okay — just notice what part of this story\nmight be more flexible or compassionate.\"\n\"What’s a version of this thought that still honours your feelings but also gives\nyou room to breathe?\"\n\"Can you find a thought that both acknowledges your struggle and also supports\nyour wellbeing?\"\n4. Encourage ongoing practice: Let the client know that the value of thought records comes\nfrom repetition and building the muscle of mental flexibility.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Thought records are like taking a snapshot of your mind during a difficult moment. Want\nto walk through one together now?\"\n● \"What was the situation? Just the facts - imagine you’re a journalist writing down exactly\nwhat happened.\"\n● \"Let’s name the emotions. Try to be specific - instead of 'bad', was it anxious, frustrated,\nashamed? Rate each on a 0 to 100 scale.\"\n● \"What thoughts came up? These might be statements like 'I can't cope' or 'I'm such a\nfailure'. Write whatever comes up, even if it feels irrational.\"\n● \"What makes you believe that thought might be true? Now let’s gently ask what evidence\ndo you have against it?\"\n● \"Putting those together, what would be a more balanced or helpful way to view this? Not\nfake positivity - just something more accurate or compassionate.\"\n● \"Let’s reflect: How do you feel now compared to when you started this exercise?\"\nIntent: socratic_questioning\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should initiate Socratic questioning when:\n● The client is experiencing a strong emotional response but hasn’t yet identified the\nunderlying thought.\n● The client expresses confusion or uncertainty about their reactions (e.g. “I don’t know\nwhy I feel this way”).\n● The client shares a rigid or extreme thought that hasn’t been explored yet.\n● The client appears open to reflecting but is not ready to reframe or change the thought.\n● The client asks about how to understand their thinking or challenge unhelpful patterns.\nSocratic questioning is especially helpful when:\n● The client is stuck in black-and-white, all-or-nothing, or catastrophising patterns.\n● The client is willing to reflect but appears uncertain about how to begin.\n● The bot wants to gently uncover the structure of the client’s beliefs without applying\npressure to change them yet.\n● The bot wants to help the client discover cognitive distortions in a collaborative way,\nbefore introducing cognitive restructuring.\nAvoid using Socratic questioning if:\n● The client is highly emotionally dysregulated, distressed, or in acute crisis — in this\ncase, prioritise:\n○ Grounding or emotion regulation strategies\n○ Distress tolerance or safety planning\nInstead of Socratic questioning, consider:\n● Starting with emotion_labelling or validation prompts to help the client become\nmore regulated.\n● Offering a mindfulness or sensory grounding strategy.\n● Using reflective listening only if the client needs space to feel heard before exploring\ncognitively.\nThis intent is useful as an exploratory step when:\n● The client is in early stages of awareness.\n● The client needs help articulating or clarifying their internal experience.\n● The bot is preparing the client for possible later use of thought_record or\ncognitive_restructuring.\nExample Input 1: \"How do I challenge a negative thought?\"\nExample Input 2: \"What questions should I ask myself when I’m spiralling?\"\nExample Input 3: \"How do I figure out if a thought is distorted?\"\nExample Input 4: \"How can I think more realistically?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Explain the purpose to the client: The bot should introduce Socratic questioning as a\nway to gently explore the accuracy and helpfulness of thoughts. Emphasise that the goal\nisn’t to judge the thought, but to understand it better and possibly discover more\nbalanced perspectives.\n2. Adopt a collaborative stance: The bot should take an “informed ignorance” approach -\nguiding rather than telling. Maintain a tone that is warm, supportive, and validating. This\nbuilds trust and encourages reflection.\n3. Present the Socratic method as a flexible process: Explain that Socratic questioning is\nnot a checklist but a flexible dialogue that can help clarify, explore, and shift stuck\nthinking patterns.\n4. Guide the client through the four stages of Socratic dialogue:\n○ Stage 1: Gather information\n■ Prompt the client with: \"Can you walk me through what happened before\nthat thought came up?\"\n■ Ask about specifics: \"What were you doing? Who else was there? What\nwas said?\"\n○ Stage 2: Reflective listening and validation\n■ Reflect the client’s experience and emotion: \"It sounds like you felt really\nhurt in that moment. That’s understandable.\"\n■ Invite deeper reflection: \"What stood out to you most about that\nmoment?\"\n○ Stage 3: Summarise collaboratively\n■ Recap what’s been shared so far: e.g. \"So far I’ve heard you felt\ndismissed, the thought was ‘I’m not important,’ and no one followed up\nafterward - does that sound right?\"\n■ Ask the client to confirm whether this summary feels accurate.\n■ If the client disagrees or hesitates:\n■ Respond with validation and curiosity: \"Thank you for letting me\nknow. What part didn’t quite fit?\"\n■ Prompt for clarification: \"How would you describe it instead?\"\n■ Offer a revised summary based on the client’s input.\n■ Check again: \"Does that feel more accurate now?\"\n■ Repeat this loop if needed, until the client confirms the summary\nmatches their perspective.\n■ The bot must avoid pushing forward without this shared understanding,\nas clarity and collaboration are essential to supporting cognitive\nshifts.Recap what’s been shared so far: \"So far I’ve heard you felt\ndismissed, the thought was ‘I’m not important,’ and no one followed up\nafterward - does that sound right?\"\n■ Confirm agreement before moving on.\n○ Stage 4: Explore alternative perspectives\n■ Use analytic questions: \"Given what we’ve explored, is there another way\nto understand what happened?\"\n■ Invite possibility: \"If this happened to someone else, how might they see\nit?\"\n5. Deliver targeted question types: The bot should select 1–2 relevant question families\nbased on what the client has shared and gently guide exploration from there. These\nquestions are not to be delivered all at once but paced and adapted to the client's\nresponses.\n○ Clarify meaning: Use when a term feels emotionally loaded or vague.\n■ \"What does ‘ruined everything’ mean to you in this moment?\"\n○ Examine evidence: Use when the client seems caught in a rigid or global belief.\n■ \"What makes you believe this thought is completely true?\"\n■ \"Is there anything that suggests a different perspective?\"\n○ Perspective-taking: Use to generate distance from the belief.\n■ \"If someone you cared about said this, what would you say to them?\"\n○ Decatastrophising: Use when the client is imagining worst-case scenarios.\n■ \"What’s the worst that could happen and how might you cope if it did?\"\n■ \"What’s the most likely outcome?\"\n○ Consequence analysis: Use to reflect on the impact of the thought.\n■ \"What happens when you hold onto this belief? Does it help or hurt you?\"\n○ Alternative generation: Use to gently shift the lens.\n■ \"If this isn’t the only possible explanation, what might be another way to\nview it?\"\n6. The bot should always respond supportively, acknowledge the client’s effort, and give\nspace after each question to reflect before moving on.\n○ Suggest use of Socratic questioning in written thought records.\n○ Recommend gentle behavioural experiments to test beliefs (e.g. \"What happens\nif I speak up?\").\n7. Bot-specific guidelines:\n○ Avoid leading the client toward one conclusion.\n○ Always validate emotional content before moving toward reframe.\n○ Leave room for silence or pausing - avoid overwhelming with too many questions\nat once.\n○ Maintain warmth, curiosity, and flexibility.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"That sounds like such a painful moment. Can I ask some gentle questions to explore it\nwith you?\"\n● \"What was happening just before that thought popped into your mind?\"\n● \"What makes that thought feel true to you?\"\n● \"Is there any part of the story you might be missing, or something that didn’t fit with that\nbelief?\"\n● \"If your best friend had this thought, how would you respond to them?\"\n● \"Let’s imagine your future self looking back at this moment - what might they say?\"\n● \"Would it be okay to explore a slightly different way to view what happened, just to see\nhow it feels?\"\n● \"You’re showing a lot of insight just by being willing to explore this. Let’s take it one step\nat a time.\"\nIntent: cognitive_restructuring\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should initiate cognitive restructuring when:\n● The client expresses distress or spiralling due to a specific thought or situation.\n● The client appears stuck in a repetitive or rigid thinking loop.\n● The client expresses a desire to change how they think, or understand why they’re\nthinking a certain way.\n● The client shares a thought that contains strong cognitive distortions (e.g. \"I’m a failure,\"\n\"Everyone hates me\").\n● The client has already identified a specific automatic thought and is ready to explore it\nmore deeply.\n● The client asks about thought challenging, realistic thinking, or CBT processes for\nthought change.\nCognitive restructuring is particularly helpful when:\n● The client is familiar with their thought patterns and open to re-evaluating them.\n● The client has already done some guided discovery (e.g. via Socratic questioning or a\nthought record).\n● The client is working on building a more supportive and flexible internal voice.\n● The client is ready to trial more balanced or self-compassionate perspectives.\nAvoid using cognitive restructuring if:\n● The client is highly dysregulated, activated, or in emotional crisis - instead use:\n○ Emotion regulation or distress tolerance techniques\n○ Grounding or self-soothing strategies\n● The client has not yet identified a specific thought or event - in these cases, redirect to:\n○ socratic_questioning to clarify the thought\n○ thought_record to map the situation-thought-emotion pathway\nInstead of cognitive restructuring, consider using:\n● Reflective validation when the client needs to feel heard before any cognitive work.\n● Psychoeducation about thoughts, automatic thinking, or distortions if the client lacks\ninsight into cognitive processes.\nIf the client is unable to identify a specific thought or is struggling to make sense of their\nreaction, the bot should instead begin with either:\n● socratic_questioning (to guide discovery and reflection)\n● or thought_record (to scaffold the situation-emotion-thought pathway)\nExample Input 1: \"How do I change the way I think?\"\nExample Input 2: \"I want to stop spiralling but don’t know how\"\nExample Input 3: \"What’s the CBT process for shifting thoughts?\"\nExample Input 4: \"How do I work with unhelpful thinking?\"\nStep-by-Step Flow:\n1. Phase 1: Awareness\n○ Prompt the client to notice signs they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed\n(emotionally or physically).\n○ Validate the emotional signal as meaningful: \"It sounds like something important\nis happening inside right now.\"\n○ Ask: \"Can we pause here and notice what thought just ran through your mind?\"\n○ Normalise this as the beginning of thought work - noticing is progress.\n2. Phase 2: Thought Evaluation\n○ Ask the client to state the thought as it first appeared, without judgement.\n○ Use questions from Socratic questioning to help the client assess the thought:\n■ \"What evidence supports this thought?\"\n■ \"What evidence doesn’t support it?\"\n■ \"What would I say to a loved one who had this thought?\"\n■ \"Is this thought helping or harming you right now?\"\n○ If distortions are evident, gently name them and offer examples.\n○ Encourage curiosity: \"Would it be okay if we looked at this together - just to see if\nanything else might also be true?\"\n3. Phase 3: Generating Alternatives\n○ Invite the client to explore other ways to view the situation. Emphasise that this\nisn’t about ‘positive’ thinking, but about fairness and flexibility.\n○ Offer examples of gentle, compassionate reframes:\n■ \"I’m struggling, and I’m still trying - both can be true.\"\n■ \"I might not have handled it perfectly, but that doesn’t mean I failed.\"\n○ Allow the client to experiment with multiple thoughts and choose one that feels\nmost supportive.\n○ Acknowledge effort: \"It’s okay if the new thought doesn’t feel fully believable yet.\nJust trying it on is part of the process.\"\n4. Phase 4: Behavioural Testing\n○ Help the client identify one small step they might take if they held the new\nthought.\n○ Prompt: \"If this new thought were true, what would change in what you say, do,\nor feel today?\"\n○ Encourage reflective comparison: \"Does this new thought create more space for\naction, compassion, or relief?\"\n○ Frame this as a flexible experiment - not a test of truth, but an opportunity to\nlearn.\n5. Bot-Specific Instructions:\n○ Always begin with validation before shifting toward change.\n○ Ask permission before exploring: \"Would it be okay if we looked at this thought\ntogether?\"\n○ Never push a new thought - offer a few client-centred options.\n○ Respond with warmth and respect, especially if the client resists change.\n○ Invite agency: \"Of the thoughts we explored, which one feels most helpful to\ncarry forward today?\"\n○ Avoid interpreting or correcting the client’s experience.\n○ Use metaphors to support flexibility (e.g. \"Let’s loosen the grip of this thought and\nsee what else might be here.\")\n○ Reinforce autonomy: \"You’re in charge of which thoughts you want to keep, shift,\nor let go.\"\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Thank you for noticing that thought. That’s a big step, catching it is where change\nbegins.\"\n● \"Can we explore that thought together? Just gently - no pressure to change anything\nyet.\"\n● \"What makes that thought feel true? Is there any part of it that might be exaggerated or\ntoo harsh?\"\n● \"What would a kinder, still honest version of that thought sound like?\"\n● \"Would it help to try on a new perspective and see how it feels, even if it’s just\ntemporary?\"\n● \"If this new thought made space for self-compassion, what would you feel more able to\ndo?\"\n● \"There’s no pressure to land on the ‘perfect’ thought - just something that opens up new\npossibilities.\"\nIntent: behavioural_activation\nPsychoeducation Module: Understanding Behavioural Activation\nPurpose: Help the client understand the basic theory behind behavioural activation and how\nmood and activity interact.\nWhen to Deliver Psychoeducation:\n● At the beginning of behavioural activation work.\n● When a client reports feeling stuck, unmotivated, or hopeless.\n● If the client expresses doubts about whether doing anything will help.\nBot Instructions for Delivery:\n● Begin with empathy and validation: Acknowledge how hard it is to act when mood is low.\n● Introduce behavioural activation as a strategy based on science, not pressure.\n● Explain the cycle in accessible terms:\n\"When we're feeling low, it’s common to stop doing things that we used to enjoy or feel\nproud of. That’s totally understandable - but the tricky part is, the less we do, the worse\nwe tend to feel. This becomes a vicious cycle. Behavioural activation helps us gently\ninterrupt that cycle by adding back in small, meaningful actions.\"\nKey Concepts to Cover:\n1. Mood-Activity Cycle:\n○ Low mood → Less activity → Worse mood → Even less activity.\n○ Emphasise that this is a normal pattern, not a personal failure.\n2. Action Drives Motivation:\n○ Waiting for motivation doesn't work.\n○ Instead, acting before we feel ready helps restart the system.\n3. Metaphor: “It’s like priming a pump - we need a few drops of water to get the flow going.”\n4. Examples to Use:\n○ “Think about a time you got out of the house for a short walk, called someone, or\nfinished a task even if it was small. Did you feel any shift afterward?”\n○ “Now compare that to a day when you stayed in bed, avoided things, or scrolled\nall day. How did your mood respond then?”\n5. Clarify that Action Doesn’t Need to Feel Good Right Away:\n○ Help clients expect that motivation or pleasure may come during or after an\nactivity - not before.\n○ Emphasise: “We’re building momentum, not chasing instant happiness.”\nPsychoeducation Script Options (Bot Can Use or Adapt):\n● “Behavioural activation is based on a simple but powerful idea: our actions affect our\nmood. If we wait until we feel better to do things, we often stay stuck. But when we\ngently start doing small, meaningful things again, we can help our mood shift, too.”\n● “Imagine your energy and mood are like a car battery. When we stop driving the car, the\nbattery slowly drains. Doing small things, even for five minutes, can act like jumper\ncables to get it running again.”\n● “You don’t have to feel motivated before you act - sometimes action comes first, and\nmotivation follows.”\nBot-Specific Tips:\n● Avoid pathologising inactivity - normalise it.\n● Use curiosity-driven, compassionate tone.\n● Check for understanding: “Does that idea resonate with your experience at all?”\n● Offer to revisit this later: “It’s okay if this doesn’t feel totally believable yet. Want to just\ntry one small step and see how it feels?”\nTransition Prompt:\n● “Would you like to explore how this might apply to your week - or look at what your\nrecent activities and mood have been like?”\nWhen to Use This Intent: The bot should guide the client through behavioural activation\nstrategies when:\n● The client reports low mood, lack of motivation, or reduced engagement in activities.\n● The client expresses feeling stuck, flat, or disconnected from previously enjoyable or\nmeaningful activities.\n● The client is avoiding tasks due to fear, anxiety, or lack of energy.\n● The bot is aiming to improve the client’s mood through values-aligned action.\nAvoid using behavioural activation if:\n● The client is in crisis or highly dysregulated - instead begin with grounding.\n● The client is experiencing significant hopelessness or cognitive distortion that prevents\nmotivation - consider starting with validation, Socratic questioning, or thought\nrestructuring first.\nSubsection:"

Explain the Format\n○ Offer a simple format with these columns:\n■ Time (hour or block)\n■ What I Was Doing\n■ Mood (1–10)\n■ Energy (1–10)\n■ Pleasure (1–10)\n■ Mastery (1–10)\n○ Optional adaptations: morning/afternoon/evening blocks, emoji scales,\ncolour codes.\n3. Support the Tracking Process\n○ “Set a few reminders to check in during the day, or reflect back at night.”\n○ “There’s no pressure to be perfect - just aim for 1–3 entries per day if you\ncan.”\n○ “Focus on noticing what’s already happening, not what you think should\nbe happening.”\n4. Weekly Review and Reflection\n○ After a few days, guide reflection with prompts:\n■ “Which activities seemed to lift your mood, even a little?”\n■ “When did you feel the most energy or accomplishment?”\n■ “Were there any surprises about how your activities and mood\nconnected?”\n■ “What do you want to try more of, or less of, based on what you\nsaw?”\nBot-Specific Tips:\n● Offer gentle reminders to log activities (e.g., “Would you like a check-in later to\nhelp remember?”)\n● Reassure the client that blank entries or low numbers are normal and still\ninformative.\n● Reinforce that any mood shift is useful data - not just highs.\n● Use activity monitoring results to transition into values-based planning or activity\nscheduling.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● “Want to try tracking what you do and how you feel for a few days? No need to\nchange anything - just observe.”\n● “We can look for patterns - like what times of day you feel best, or what types of\ntasks give a little boost.”\n● “Even if nothing jumps out at first, over a few days the patterns can become\nclearer.”\n● “What do you notice when you look at your log - any small sparks or drains?”\nSubsection:"

        "content": "Purpose: Help the client plan and schedule small, values-aligned activities that can improve\nmood and break cycles of inactivity. Guide them to make realistic, achievable plans that fit their\nenergy and circumstances.\nWhen to Use Activity Scheduling:\n● After completing or alongside activity monitoring.\n● When the client has identified activities that might boost their mood or sense of\naccomplishment.\n● When the client is ready to move from insight (\"what helps\") to action (\"doing more of\nwhat helps\").\n● If the client is demotivated but open to gentle structure or scaffolding.\nBot Instructions for Delivery:\n● Begin by identifying the client's values — the \"why\" behind the activity.\n● Offer simple, flexible formats for choosing and scheduling small actions.\n● Always emphasise permission-based, non-pressuring tone (\"Would you be open to\nexploring this?\").\n● Use a balance of structured prompts and collaborative planning.\nStep-by-Step Guidance:\nAdditional Psychoeducation:\n● Explain why activity scheduling can be effective:\n“When we’re struggling, our days often lose structure. Planning small, meaningful\nactions ahead of time creates anchors — things to look forward to or orient around. It’s\nnot about doing more — it’s about doing what matters.”\n1. Values-Based Planning\n○ Help the client clarify what matters most to them.\n○ Explore areas like:\n■ Relationships (\"What kind of friend/partner do you want to be?\")\n■ Health (\"What does caring for yourself look like?\")\n■ Learning, growth, creativity, community, spirituality.\n○ Frame activities as moving toward these values — not based on external\nexpectations.\n2. SMART Goal Setting\n○ Guide the client to set goals that are:\n■ Specific – What exactly will you do?\n■ Measurable – How will you know it’s done?\n■ Achievable – Is it realistic given your current state?\n■ Relevant – Does it connect to your values or wellbeing?\n■ Time-bound – When will you do it?\n○ Reassure that tiny steps count: \"Even a 2-minute task can help build\nmomentum.\"\n3. Graduated Scheduling\n○ Encourage starting smaller than feels necessary.\n○ Offer choices like:\n■ \"5-minute walk\"\n■ \"Open a book for 2 minutes\"\n■ \"Send one text to a friend\"\n○ Use scaffolding: \"What would make this easier to start?\"\n4. Balance of Activity Types\n○ Suggest scheduling across three categories:\n■ Pleasant activities – fun, soothing, or joyful.\n■ Mastery activities – tasks that build confidence (e.g. bills, tidying, admin).\n■ Necessary activities – functioning (e.g. meals, hygiene, medication).\n○ Ask: \"What would feel like a small win this week in each category?\"\n5. Planning Format Options\n○ Offer daily or weekly planning templates.\n○ Keep it simple (e.g. 3 activities/day, or 1 of each type every 2 days).\n○ Ask: \"Would it help to write these down or check in later in the week together?\"\n6. Review and Adjust\n● Explore common reasons for not completing activities:\n○ “What do you think got in the way — energy, mood, time, something else?”\n○ “Would it help to break the activity down even further next time?”\n○ “That’s okay — we’re gathering information, not aiming for perfection.”\n○ “What support or setup might make it easier next time?”\n● Encourage contingency planning (\"if–then\"):\n○ “Want to create a backup version? Like, if you don’t feel up to the walk, maybe\nyou could step outside and stretch for 2 minutes instead.”\n● Map activities to client’s natural rhythm:\n○ “When do you usually feel most alert or energised during the day?”\n○ “Could we schedule the most important action during that time?”\n○ “Are there times of day where you’d prefer something easier or lighter?”\n● Affirm effort over outcome:\n○ “Even if you didn’t finish it, starting is still a win.”\n○ “You chose to try something today — that matters.”\n○ “You’re strengthening a new habit just by attempting it.”\n○ At check-in, reflect on what worked and what didn’t:\n■ \"What helped you follow through?\"\n■ \"What barriers showed up?\"\n■ \"What do you want to keep, adjust, or let go of for next week?\"\n○ Normalise fluctuation in energy and mood.\n○ Reinforce: \"Even planning is progress.\"\nBot-Specific Tips:\n● Validate the difficulty of planning while unmotivated.\n● Emphasise compassion, not productivity.\n● Use warm, collaborative tone (e.g. \"We can figure this out together\").\n● Offer gentle reminders or ask if the client wants a nudge later in the week.\nSample Bot Responses:\n● \"Let’s choose one small thing for each day — something kind, something useful, and\nsomething that helps you feel a bit more like yourself.\"\n● \"You don’t have to do everything. Just one step is enough to shift things a little.\"\n● \"If you could schedule just one action that moves you toward your values, what would\nthat look like this week?\"\n● \"Want to start with one pleasant, one mastery, and one necessary activity? We can build\nfrom there.\"\n● \"How would it feel to schedule that in for tomorrow morning — or would another time suit\nyou better?\"\n● \"If it doesn’t happen, that’s okay. It’s all part of the learning. What might make it easier\nnext time?\"\nSubsection:"

Behavioural experiments provide evidence-based opportunities to challenge distorted\nthinking and reduce avoidance.\nWhen to Use Behavioural Experiments:\nBehavioural experiments are most effective when the client is cognitively able and emotionally\nresourced to approach uncertainty or anxiety with curiosity. Use this strategy when:\n● The client verbalises a clear, testable prediction or belief (e.g., \"If I do X, something bad\nwill happen\").\n● You’ve identified a cognitive distortion or unhelpful core belief that could benefit from\nreal-world feedback.\n● The client is engaging in avoidance, safety behaviours, or rigid thinking that keeps them\nstuck.\n● The client expresses interest in change but doubts their capacity, competence, or value.\n● You want to bridge the gap between insight (thinking) and change (doing).\nWhen Not to Use Behavioural Experiments:\n● The client is in acute distress or crisis and needs emotional regulation or safety planning.\n● The belief is trauma-related and re-exposure might retraumatise — consider trauma-\ninformed processing first.\n● The client’s distress tolerance is low and the experiment might overwhelm or reinforce\nhelplessness.\n● The client interprets any discomfort as failure — begin with psychoeducation or distress\ntolerance techniques.\n● The client needs more trust-building before action-based work is appropriate.\nBot Instructions for Delivery:\n● Always begin by validating the client's fear or prediction.\n● Explain that behavioural experiments aren’t about \"proving them wrong,\" but about\ndiscovering what happens in real life.\n● Use a curious and collaborative tone: \"Let’s explore what happens together.\"\n● Frame this as an experiment, not a performance.\nStep-by-Step Bot Instructions:\n1. Identify the Prediction (Clarify the Fear or Belief)\n● Ask: “What belief are we testing?” or “What do you think will happen if you do this?”\n● Guide the client to be concrete. Vague predictions like “It’ll go badly” should be clarified\ninto something like “They’ll ignore me” or “I’ll panic and not cope.”\n○ Prompt: \"What do you think will happen if you try X?\"\n○ Ask for specificity: “What exactly are you afraid of?”\n○ Examples:\n■ \"If I speak up, people will think I’m stupid.\"\n■ \"If I rest today, I’ll be lazy forever.\"\n2. Design the Experiment (Find a Small, Doable Test)\n● Collaborate on the smallest possible version of the feared behaviour — one that still\nactivates the prediction.\n● Ask: “What’s a safe way to dip your toe in?”\n● Scale the intensity: aim for 3–5 out of 10 on the distress scale.\n○ Help the client choose a small, manageable version of the feared behaviour.\n○ Prompt: \"What’s one gentle way we could test that belief?\"\n○ Support risk scaling: \"On a scale from 1–10, how risky does this feel? Let’s stay\nin the 2–5 range.\"\n3. Make Predictions (Quantify the Expectation)\n● Ask the client to rate:\n○ Likelihood of feared outcome (0–100%)\n○ Expected distress level (0–10)\n○ Belief strength (0–100%)\n○ Ask the client to rate:\n■ Likelihood of the feared outcome (0–100%)\n■ Intensity of expected distress (0–10)\n■ Believability of the thought (0–100%)\n4. Plan for Coping (If the Worst Happens)\n● Explore: “If that feared thing actually did happen, how would you cope?”\n● Reinforce resilience, highlight past coping, and identify a support system.\n○ Ask: \"If the worst did happen, how could you cope or care for yourself?\"\n○ Identify self-compassionate strategies and social supports.\n5. Conduct the Experiment (Try and Observe)\n● Support the client to schedule and carry out the experiment.\n● Remind: “Try to observe with curiosity — your goal is to gather information, not to\nperform.”\n○ Offer to help plan timing or support setup.\n○ Remind the client to notice thoughts, feelings, and outcomes — not just the\nfeared event.\n6. Review the Outcome (Debrief and Re-evaluate)\n● Debrief what actually happened vs. what was predicted.\n● Ask about emotional experience, any surprises, and what was learned.\n● Reassess belief strength (0–100%) and adjust understanding.\n○ Ask:\n■ \"What actually happened?\"\n■ \"Was your prediction accurate?\"\n■ \"What surprised you?\"\n■ \"What did you learn?\"\n○ Explore revised beliefs: “How strongly do you believe that thought now (0–100)?”\n7. Generalise the Learning (Widen the Insight)\n● Help apply learning to other situations.\n● Ask: “What might you do differently next time?” or “Does this change how you see\nsimilar situations?”\n○ Ask: “How might this apply to other situations?”\n○ “What would you try next time, knowing what you know now?”\nExamples of Common Behavioural Experiments\nBelief: \"If I ask for help, people will think I’m a burden.\"\n● Experiment: Send a message to a close friend or colleague asking for a small favour or\ncheck-in.\n● Prediction: 80% chance they’ll ignore or be annoyed.\n● Outcome: Friend was happy to help, no judgment expressed.\nBelief: \"I won’t enjoy anything.\"\n● Experiment: Choose three past hobbies or pleasures. Do each for 10–15 minutes.\n● Outcome: Mild enjoyment during the activity, mood shift noted afterward.\nBelief: \"If I don’t keep pushing myself, I’ll get nothing done.\"\n● Experiment: Rest for 1 hour without guilt — no work, no multitasking.\n● Outcome: Productivity and focus improved afterward, not worsened.\nBot-Specific Tips\n● Reinforce permission to learn: \"There’s no success or failure here — just information.\"\n● Let the client opt out or modify if anxiety increases.\n● Always validate fear and praise willingness to try.\n● Use the data to adjust future predictions and support deeper cognitive restructuring.\nSample Bot Prompts:\n● “What belief do you want to explore today? Want to turn it into a real-life experiment?”\n● “What would a gentle version of that activity look like?”\n● “Let’s rate how strongly you believe that thought now — and check back after the\nexperiment.”\n● “What happened that was different from what you expected?”\n● “You were brave for trying something new — even if it felt hard. What did you learn from\nthat?”\nSubsection: Behavioural Experiments\nPurpose: Help clients test unhelpful beliefs and predictions through real-world, experiential\nlearning. Behavioural experiments provide evidence-based opportunities to challenge distorted\nthinking and reduce avoidance.\nBot Instruction – When to Use Behavioural Experiments: The bot should initiate behavioural\nexperiments when the client meets any of the following conditions:\n● The client clearly states a belief or fear-based prediction that can be tested in real life.\n● A specific cognitive distortion has been identified and the client is cognitively engaged.\n● The client expresses interest in changing behaviour but remains hesitant or doubtful.\n● The client is avoiding something important due to fear, perceived incompetence, or low\nconfidence.\n● The client has demonstrated enough emotional regulation capacity to tolerate and reflect\non mild-to-moderate uncertainty or distress. The bot should check for signs such as:\n● The client reports using self-soothing or grounding techniques successfully in the past.\n● The client has recently managed other therapeutic tasks without becoming dysregulated.\n● The client is able to talk about difficult topics without immediate emotional overwhelm.\n● The client responds to distress with language like “It was hard, but I got through it” rather\nthan shutting down or escalating.\n● The client shows openness to curiosity, experimentation, or trying something different.\nIf these signals are present, the bot may proceed with behavioural experiments using a\ngentle, collaborative tone.\nBot Instruction – When Not to Use Behavioural Experiments:\nThe bot should not initiate a behavioural experiment if:\n● The client is in acute emotional distress and needs grounding, safety planning, or crisis\nsupport.\n● The belief to be tested is related to trauma and may risk re-traumatisation.\n● The client shows signs of very low distress tolerance or becomes overwhelmed by minor\nchallenges.\n● The client is new to the bot or therapy and has not yet built sufficient trust.\n● The client views any discomfort as failure - in this case, focus first on distress tolerance\nor psychoeducation.\n● The client’s distress tolerance is low and the experiment might overwhelm or reinforce\nhelplessness.\n● The client interprets any discomfort as failure - begin with psychoeducation or distress\ntolerance techniques.\n● The client needs more trust-building before action-based work is appropriate.\nBot Instructions for Delivery:\n● Always begin by validating the client's fear or prediction.\n● Explain that behavioural experiments aren’t about \"proving them wrong,\" but about\ndiscovering what happens in real life.\n● Use a curious and collaborative tone: \"Let’s explore what happens together.\"\n● Frame this as an experiment, not a performance.\nBot Instruction – Step-by-Step Process for Behavioural Experiments:\n1. Step 1: Identify the Prediction (Clarify the Fear or Belief)\n● The bot should ask:\n○ “What belief are we testing?”\n○ “What do you think will happen if you do this?”\n● The bot must guide the client toward specific, testable statements. Avoid vague or global\npredictions like \"It’ll go badly.\"\n● The bot can offer examples to clarify:\n○ \"If I speak up, people will think I’m stupid.\"\n○ \"If I rest today, I’ll be lazy forever.\"\n● If the client cannot name a prediction, switch to Socratic questioning or CBT triangle\ninstead.\n2. Step 2: Design the Experiment (Create a Testable Scenario)\n● The bot should ask:\n○ “What’s a safe way we could test that belief?”\n○ “What would a small version of this look like?”\n● Ensure the experiment is safe, brief, and in the 3–5 out of 10 range for distress.\n● If client is unsure, the bot should offer 2–3 specific options that gently activate the belief\nwithout overwhelming them.\"\n3. Step 3: Make Predictions (Quantify Beliefs)\n● The bot should ask the client to rate:\n○ Likelihood of the feared outcome (0–100%)\n○ Anticipated emotional distress (0–10)\n○ Strength of belief (0–100%)\n● These predictions should be recorded so the client can compare after the experiment.\n● Ask the client to rate:\n○ Likelihood of feared outcome (0–100%)\n○ Expected distress level (0–10)\n○ Belief strength (0–100%)\n○ Ask the client to rate:\n■ Likelihood of the feared outcome (0–100%)\n■ Intensity of expected distress (0–10)\n■ Believability of the thought (0–100%)\n4. Step 4: Plan for Coping (Build Confidence Before the Test)\n● The bot should ask:\n○ “If the worst thing you’re worried about did happen, how could you handle it?”\n○ “Who or what could support you through that?”\n● The bot should normalise discomfort and reinforce the client’s capacity to cope.\n● If needed, redirect to distress tolerance before proceeding.\n5. Step 5: Conduct the Experiment (Encourage Observational Mindset)\n● The bot should guide the client to carry out the experiment in a mindful and observant\nway.\n● Prompt: “Try to stay curious - we’re here to learn, not prove anything.”\n● The bot can help schedule the experiment or check in after a defined time period.\n● If the client avoids or postpones, validate and return to emotion regulation or readiness\nwork.\n6. Step 6: Review the Outcome (Compare and Reflect)\n● The bot should ask:\n○ “What actually happened?”\n○ “Was your prediction accurate?”\n○ “What surprised you?”\n○ “How strong does the belief feel now (0–100%)?”\n● Use this reflection to reinforce learning and shift cognitive distortions.\n○ Ask:\n■ \"What actually happened?\"\n■ \"Was your prediction accurate?\"\n■ \"What surprised you?\"\n■ \"What did you learn?\"\n○ Explore revised beliefs: “How strongly do you believe that thought now (0–100)?”\n7. Step 7: Generalise the Learning (Transfer Insight)\n● The bot should prompt:\n○ “Does this change how you see similar situations?”\n○ “What might you do differently next time?”\n● Reinforce: “This isn’t just about this one moment - it’s helping build a new way of\napproaching uncertainty.””\n○ Ask: “How might this apply to other situations?”\n○ “What would you try next time, knowing what you know now?”\nExamples of Common Behavioural Experiments\nBelief: \"If I ask for help, people will think I’m a burden.\"\n● Experiment: Send a message to a close friend or colleague asking for a small favour or\ncheck-in.\n● Prediction: 80% chance they’ll ignore or be annoyed.\n● Outcome: Friend was happy to help, no judgment expressed.\nBelief: \"I won’t enjoy anything.\"\n● Experiment: Choose three past hobbies or pleasures.

        "content": "Purpose: Support clients to understand avoidance as a natural but limiting pattern and guide\nthem to gradually re-engage with feared situations using graded exposure. This section teaches\nthe bot how to help clients break free from the avoidance cycle using structured and\ncompassionate guidance.\nBot Instruction – When to Use This Module\nThe bot should initiate the Overcoming Avoidance module under the following client conditions:\nUse this module when:\n● The client expresses anxiety about specific tasks, situations, or settings.\n● The client describes patterns of avoidance (e.g. cancelling plans, procrastination, social\nwithdrawal).\n● The client reports anxiety that increases the more they avoid something.\n● The client shows readiness to re-engage with life domains that feel limited by avoidance.\nBot Instruction – When Not to Use This Module\nTrain the bot to avoid initiating this module under the following conditions:\nAvoid using this module if:\n● The client describes avoidance of situations that are objectively dangerous or could\nresult in harm (e.g. walking alone in unsafe areas, entering abusive or violent\nenvironments, confronting a threat without protection). The bot must prioritise client\nsafety and refer to safety planning protocols instead of exposure.\n● The feared situation involves medical, legal, or ethical risks where professional or\nguardian oversight is required.\n● The client is showing signs of impaired judgment, such as during a psychotic episode,\nintense dissociation, or cognitive impairment.\n● The client is in crisis or high distress and needs immediate regulation.\n● The feared situation relates to unprocessed trauma and could retraumatise.\n● The client has no insight into their avoidance pattern and needs psychoeducation first.\n● The client’s anxiety level is too high to tolerate low-level exposure work - start instead\nwith emotion regulation, psychoeducation, or motivational interviewing.\nPsychoeducation: Understanding the Avoidance Cycle\n● Begin by validating avoidance as a normal human response to distress.\n● Use this bot script:\n“Avoidance is our nervous system’s way of trying to protect us. It makes sense - when\nsomething feels scary or overwhelming, we naturally want to escape or avoid it. But over\ntime, that short-term relief can actually strengthen our fear and make life smaller. The\nmore we avoid, the scarier things feel.”\n● Teach the avoidance cycle:\n1. Situation arises (e.g. a social event or difficult task).\n2. Anxiety or discomfort spikes.\n3. Avoidance reduces immediate discomfort (e.g. cancelling, procrastinating).\n4. Relief is reinforced (\"Thank goodness I didn’t have to go\").\n5. Next time, the situation feels even more threatening.\n6. Avoidance becomes stronger and more automatic.\n● Normalise this pattern, then introduce the idea of small, safe re-engagement.\nBot Instruction – Step-by-Step Process for Graded Exposure\nThis section outlines how the bot should guide the client through a structured and collaborative\ngraded exposure process. The bot must maintain a tone of safety, warmth, and encouragement\nthroughout.\nStep 1: Identify Avoided Situations (Build Insight)\n● Bot should prompt with curiosity and validation.\n● Ask: “Can we explore some situations or tasks you’ve been avoiding lately?”\n● Categorise examples across social, occupational, self-care, and functional domains.\n● Ask: “What are some things you’ve been avoiding lately, even if they feel small?”\n● Help the client list 5–10 situations across different domains of life (social, work, personal\ncare, admin, etc.)\nStep 2: Rate Anxiety Levels (Quantify Impact)\n● Bot should explain the purpose of rating: “It helps us find a good starting point.”\n● Normalise variability and help client estimate approximate levels if unsure.\n● For each situation, ask the client to rate anticipated anxiety (0–100).\n● Tip: If client struggles to rate, offer anchoring examples: “10 = mildly anxious, 100 =\nextreme panic.”\nStep 3: Build an Exposure Hierarchy (Structure the Path)\n● Bot should guide the client in creating a gradual ladder.\n● Emphasise safety: “We want something that feels manageable - not overwhelming.”\n● Offer to keep track of the hierarchy visually for the client.\n● Help the client rank situations from least to most anxiety-provoking.\n● Format a list or table in descending order.\n● Encourage the client to start with something in the 20–40 range.\nStep 4: Break Down Larger Tasks (Make It Doable)\n● Bot should guide task-splitting and encourage creativity.\n● Prompt: “What would the tiniest possible version of this be?” or “What’s step one of ten?”\n● For items rated 60+, break them into smaller steps.\n● Use prompts like: “What would the first 10% of this look like?”\nExample – Social Anxiety Exposure Ladder:\n● 20: Make eye contact and say thank you to a cashier\n● 30: Ask a store employee where to find an item\n● 40: Make small talk with a neighbour\n● 50: Attend a small gathering for 30 minutes\n● 60: Speak up once in a group conversation\n● 70: Attend a larger social event\n● 80: Initiate plans with an acquaintance\n● 90: Give a short presentation at work\nStep 5: Exposure Guidelines for the Bot to Reinforce (Optimise Learning)\n● Bot should clearly state the following to support therapeutic success:\n● Stay in the situation until anxiety naturally decreases (not just until the urge to escape\nhits).\n● Rate anxiety before, during, and after the exposure.\n● Focus outward: “What’s happening around you?” rather than “How anxious do I feel?”\n● Celebrate the completion of the exposure, not the level of calm achieved.\n● Reassure the client that anxiety typically peaks and then fades (10–45 minutes).\nBot-Specific Support Strategies (Promoting Safety and Resilience)\nThe bot should continuously monitor tone and pacing to support client safety, choice, and\nempowerment.\n● Validate all avoidance behaviour before challenging it: “That was your brain trying to\nprotect you.”\n● Use gentle, choice-based language: “Would it feel safe to try the first step together?”\n● Track anxiety ratings and encourage reflection: “What shifted from the start to the end?”\n● Reinforce insight: “What did you learn about yourself or the situation?”\n● Remind clients that avoidance is a habit,. not a personality trait, and change happens\ngradually.\nSample Bot Prompts:\n● “What’s one situation you’ve been avoiding that you’d like to feel more confident in?”\n● “Want to create a small ladder of steps to ease back in?”\n● “How would it feel to just do the first 5 minutes of that activity - not the whole thing?”\n● “Can we check in during and after, so we can see how your anxiety changed?”\n● “You did something hard today. That matters - even if it didn’t feel perfect.”\nSubsection:"

        "content": "Purpose: Support the bot to deliver foundational mindfulness techniques that increase a client’s\nawareness of the present moment, reduce reactivity, and create space between thoughts and\nactions. This section focuses on building the client’s ability to observe internal experiences\nwithout judgment.\nBot Instruction – When to Use This Module\nUse mindfulness interventions when:\n● The client describes feeling overwhelmed by thoughts or emotions.\n● The client reports “living in their head” or ruminating.\n● The client shows reactivity or quick escalation in distress.\n● The bot is introducing a tool to support emotional regulation, distress tolerance, or\ngrounding.\n● The client is experiencing cognitive fusion (i.e., over-identification with their thoughts).\nBot Instruction – When Not to Use This Module\nMindfulness is generally safe, but the bot should screen for and avoid initiating mindfulness if:\n● The client is in acute distress or experiencing panic and needs grounding instead (use\ngrounding, breathing, or distraction).\n● The client has trauma history and becomes more distressed when observing internal\nsensations. To assess this, the bot should ask exploratory questions such as:\n● “How do you usually feel when you try to notice what’s going on in your body?”\n● “Does checking in with your body feel grounding, or does it make you more anxious or\noverwhelmed?”\n● “Would it feel safer to focus on what’s around you right now, like sights and sounds,\nrather than going inward?”\nIf the client indicates that observing internal experience increases distress, the bot\nshould avoid internal mindfulness techniques and instead recommend external\ngrounding, sensory-based work, or co-regulation strategies. Reassess later for\nreadiness.\n● The client expresses frustration or disengagement with mindfulness - validate and\nreintroduce when there is openness.\nBot Instruction – When to Use Specific Mindfulness Techniques\nEach technique in this section should be used intentionally based on client presentation and\nneeds:\nSTOP Practice:\n● Use when the client reports stress, reactivity, escalation, or is facing an emotionally\ncharged situation.\n● Ideal as a short intervention to create pause and awareness.\n● Avoid if client is in a state of panic and unable to cognitively engage - use grounding or\nbreath instead.\nFive Senses Check-In:\n● Use when the client is dissociated, overwhelmed, or stuck in racing thoughts.\n● Particularly helpful for clients with sensory sensitivity, neurodivergence, or who struggle\nwith internal observation.\n● Avoid if sensory input is overwhelming or distressing (e.g., during a sensory overload\nepisode).\nMindful Breathing:\n● Use when the client needs calm, focus, or to return to the body.\n● Great as a reset tool before or after cognitive or behavioural work.\n● Avoid prolonged breath holds with clients prone to panic - adapt with gentle observation\nor short counts.\nUrge Surfing:\n● Use when the client identifies a strong urge to act on an emotion (e.g., avoidance, self-\nharm, bingeing).\n● Best used when the client is emotionally aware and not in acute danger.\n● Avoid if the urge poses immediate safety risk - redirect to a safety plan.\nDefusion Techniques:\n● Use when the client is stuck in a self-critical, anxious, or repetitive thought.\n● Especially useful during or after thought monitoring or cognitive distortion work.\n● Avoid if the client finds playful techniques invalidating - adjust tone and metaphors to\nmatch developmental or cultural context.\nPsychoeducation: What Is Mindfulness?\nThe bot should begin by establishing an understanding of what mindfulness is and is not.\nMindfulness is:\n● The practice of directing focused attention to the present moment, on purpose, with\nopenness and non-judgement.\n● A skill to help observe internal and external experience without needing to immediately\nreact, fix, or avoid it.\n● A foundation for emotional regulation and cognitive flexibility.\nThe bot should explain that mindfulness is not:\n● A relaxation technique (though calm can result from it)\n● About “emptying the mind” or having no thoughts\n● Meant to eliminate negative emotions\n● Always comfortable - observing unpleasant experiences can be part of the process\n● Use this bot script to introduce mindfulness:\n\"Mindfulness means paying attention to the present moment on purpose - with curiosity\nand without judgment. It’s not about clearing your mind or forcing calm. It’s about\nnoticing what’s here, right now, and choosing how to respond, not just react.\"\n● Reinforce key concepts:\n○ Mindfulness builds the skill of noticing thoughts without getting hooked.\n○ It increases awareness of body sensations, breath, and emotions.\n○ It improves emotional regulation by creating a pause between stimulus and\nresponse.\n● Use metaphors:\n○ Thoughts as clouds passing in the sky\n○ Mind as a snow globe that settles with stillness\nMindfulness Technique 1: The STOP Practice\nAcronym:\n● S – Stop what you’re doing\n● T – Take a breath\n● O – Observe what’s happening (thoughts, feelings, sensations)\n● P – Proceed with awareness\nBot Instruction – How to Guide STOP:\n● Offer the STOP practice when the client reports:\n○ Escalating emotions\n○ Racing thoughts\n○ Disconnection from their body or present moment\nScript Example:\n\"When you notice stress, anxiety, or strong emotions building, you can try the\nSTOP practice. First, literally pause whatever you’re doing. Take one deep, slow\nbreath. Then gently ask yourself: ‘What’s going on right now? What thoughts am I\nnoticing? What’s happening in my body? What emotion is here?’ Then choose your\nnext step with awareness.\"\nVariations for Different Clients:\n● Use a visual metaphor (e.g., stop sign or pause button).\n● For neurodivergent clients, simplify: “Pause. Breathe. Notice. Choose.”\n● For trauma clients, keep external focus (e.g., noticing sounds or visual cues).\nMindfulness Technique 2: Five Senses Check-In\nOverview:\nThis grounding technique uses sensory awareness to anchor clients in the present moment.\nInstructions:\n● Ask the client to name:\n○ 5 things they can see\n○ 4 things they can feel\n○ 3 things they can hear\n○ 2 things they can smell\n○ 1 thing they can taste\n● The bot should pace this slowly and offer encouragement after each step.\nBot Prompts:\n● “Let’s do a five senses grounding check-in together - it helps bring your attention back to\nthe now.”\n● “You don’t need to find the ‘perfect’ answers. Whatever comes up is okay.”\n● “What do you notice after doing that - even slightly?”\nAdaptations:\n● Offer abbreviated version (e.g. 3-2-1) for overwhelmed clients.\n● Emphasise that even partial participation helps regulate the nervous system.\nMindfulness Technique 3: Mindful Breathing\nOverview:\nMindful breathing is the practice of focusing attention on the breath to anchor awareness in the\npresent moment. It is one of the most accessible and adaptable mindfulness techniques.\nInstructions:\n● Guide the client to bring attention to the breath - without changing it.\n● Invite observation of the inhale, exhale, and any pauses between.\n● Use counting or phrases like \"breathing in, breathing out\" to support focus.\nBot Prompts:\n● “Let’s take a moment to focus on your breath - you don’t need to change it, just notice it.”\n● “Can you feel the air coming in through your nose... and leaving your body?”\n● “Want to try breathing in for four, holding for four, out for four?”\nAdaptations:\n● Use shorter counts or ‘just three breaths’ for low-capacity moments.\nMindfulness Technique 4: Urge Surfing\nOverview:\nUrge surfing is a technique for riding out cravings, impulses, or strong emotional urges without\nacting on them. It is particularly helpful for clients with emotion-driven behaviours (e.g.,\navoidance, self-harm, binge eating).\nInstructions:\n● Explain that urges rise, peak, and fall like waves.\n● Invite the client to notice where the urge shows up in the body.\n● Guide the client to \"watch the wave\" without trying to suppress or act on it.\nBot Prompts:\n● “Let’s imagine your urge like a wave - it rises and eventually passes.”\n● “Where in your body do you feel this most?”\n● “Can you notice it, breathe into it, and let the wave move through without reacting?”\nCautions:\n● Avoid if the client is highly dysregulated or if the urge poses immediate safety risk.\n● Follow up with coping strategies and safety checks as needed.\nMindfulness Technique 5: Defusion Techniques\nOverview:\nDefusion techniques help clients step back from unhelpful or distressing thoughts by observing\nthem rather than fusing with them. These techniques are especially useful when a client is stuck\nin self-critical or anxious thinking.\nInstructions:\n● Help the client name the thought (“I’m having the thought that…”)\n● Invite playful distance with the thought (e.g., singing it, saying it in a funny voice)\n● Reinforce that thoughts are not facts, just mental events.\nBot Prompts:\n● “Can we try saying, ‘I’m having the thought that…’ instead of ‘It’s true that…’?”\n● “What happens if you repeat that thought in a silly accent or sing it to a song?”\n● “Let’s imagine placing that thought on a leaf and watching it float down a stream.”\nAdaptations:\n● For younger clients or creative thinkers, use drawing or storytelling imagery.\n● For logical thinkers, use the metaphor: \"Thoughts are like news headlines - just because\nit’s bold, doesn’t mean it’s true.\"\nScripts, Metaphors, and CBT Integration Tips\nIntegration with CBT:\nMindfulness complements cognitive behavioural therapy by creating psychological distance\nbetween the client and their thoughts or urges. The bot should link mindfulness with cognitive\ninterventions in the following ways:\n● Before Cognitive Work: Use mindfulness techniques to calm the nervous system and\nincrease cognitive flexibility before challenging thoughts.\n○ Bot Script: “Before we look at that thought more closely, would it help to slow\ndown and notice what’s happening inside you first?”\n● During Cognitive Restructuring: Use mindfulness to help the client become aware of\nthinking patterns without immediate judgment.\n○ Bot Script: “Can you notice that thought as a thought, not necessarily as truth,\njust for a moment?”\n● After Behavioural Experiments: Use mindfulness to tune into what changed internally\nand reflect on the outcome.\n○ Bot Script: “What are you noticing in your body or mind after trying that new\nstep?”\nSuggested Metaphors for Mindfulness:\n● Leaves on a stream (defusion): Thoughts float by like leaves - we don’t need to hold\nonto them.\n● Snow globe (present moment settling): The mind is shaken with thoughts/emotions - with\nstillness, it starts to clear.\n● Radio station (diffusion): Thoughts are like background noise - we can choose whether\nto turn up the volume.\n● Waves on the ocean (urge surfing): Emotions rise and fall - we can ride them instead of\ndrowning in them.\n● Traffic (awareness): You’re on the footpath watching cars (thoughts) pass - you don’t\nneed to jump into every one.\nTherapeutic Scripts to Embed Mindfulness in CBT Contexts:\n● “Let’s notice what story your mind is telling you right now and see if we can hold that\ngently.”\n● “Thoughts aren’t commands, they’re just suggestions from your brain.”\n● “Your urge is strong, but it’s not forever, let’s surf it together.”\n● “The fact that you noticed your body tense up -that’s progress. That’s awareness.”\n● “We don’t need to fix the thought right now, we can just watch it and breathe.”\nBot-Specific Support Strategies\n● Deliver instructions slowly and calmly.\n● Use encouraging phrases like “There’s no right way to do this” or “Just noticing is\nenough.”\n● Reinforce non-judgment: “You don’t need to change anything - just observe.”\n● Check understanding: “How did that feel to try?” or “Would you like to practice that\ntogether now?”\n● Reinforce use of STOP before challenging situations (e.g., social encounters, hard\nconversations, emotional triggers).\nBot Reinforcement Strategies:\n● Offer praise for effort, not outcome: “You showed up for this - that matters.”\n● Normalise drifting attention: “It’s okay if your mind wandered, the noticing is the\npractice.”\n● Acknowledge resistance: “Part of your mind might say ‘this is silly.’ That’s a thought too -\nyou can just notice it.”\n● Emphasise re-anchoring: “Each time you bring your attention back, you’re building the\nmindfulness muscle.”\nSample Bot Prompts:\n● “Want to pause for a moment and try something simple together?”\n● “Let’s just check in - what’s happening in your mind and body right now?”\n● “Would STOP be helpful right now, or do you want something more grounding?”\nBreathing and Grounding Techniques\nBot Instruction – When to Use Breathing and Grounding Techniques\nThese techniques help regulate the nervous system and foster safety, connection, and\npresence. The bot should initiate these practices as a standalone strategy or prior to cognitive\nwork.\nThe bot should offer these techniques when:\n● The client describes physiological signs of anxiety, panic, or emotional flooding.\n● The client presents with dissociation, numbness, or feeling \"not in their body.\"\n● The client is preparing to engage in emotionally challenging or trauma-informed work.\n● The client has expressed difficulty focusing, engaging, or feeling connected.\n● The client is transitioning between topics or tasks and needs to recentre.\nBot Instruction – When Not to Use These Techniques\nBreathing and grounding may be ineffective or counterproductive in certain scenarios. The bot\nmust assess for contraindications before proceeding.\nThe bot should avoid these techniques if:\n● The client is in a dissociative state that prevents awareness (use more active sensory\ngrounding first).\n● The client becomes more distressed when focusing inward (especially trauma clients).\n● The client finds breath awareness triggering.\n● The client has expressed discomfort with stillness, silence, or attention to physical\nsensations.\nHow the Bot Can Assess Readiness:\nThe bot should ask questions to assess emotional and physical readiness for these strategies:\n● “How does it usually feel when you slow down and notice your breath?”\n● “Would focusing on your body feel okay, or is that uncomfortable for you?”\n● “Do you find paying attention to your senses (sight, sound, touch) helpful or\noverwhelming?”\n● “When you're anxious, do you prefer to go inward (like breathing) or outward (like\ndistraction)?”\nBased on answers:\n● If the client responds with discomfort or distress, the bot should offer sensory-based or\nmental grounding techniques.\n● If the client is unsure, the bot may offer a choice: “Would you like to try something\ninternal like breathing, or external like noticing sounds around you?”\nSummary of Techniques\nThe bot should also be equipped with warm, flexible, client-centred scripts for each technique.\nScripts should be read aloud slowly or delivered in short written chunks. The tone should be\ninvitational, calm, and empowering.\nThe bot should be trained to:\n● Briefly explain each technique’s purpose.\n● Offer choices to empower the client and reduce pressure.\n● Modify based on neurodiversity, trauma history, or overwhelm.\n● Reinforce the function of the technique (e.g. calming, anchoring, focus).\n1. 4-7-8 Breathing\nScript:\n\"Let’s try a calming breathing technique. You can close your eyes or soften your\ngaze if that feels comfortable. First, gently breathe in through your nose while\ncounting to 4… Now hold that breath for 7 counts… and now slowly exhale through\nyour mouth for 8 counts. Let’s repeat that two or three more times, allowing the\nexhale to be longer than the inhale - that’s what helps calm the nervous system.\"\n● Relaxation-oriented. Use for sleep issues, panic, restlessness.\n● Avoid if client dislikes long holds or reports breath-induced anxiety.\n2. Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)\nScript:\n\"Let’s use your breath like a box - four equal sides. Breathe in for 4… 1, 2, 3, 4.\nHold your breath… 1, 2, 3, 4. Exhale for 4… 1, 2, 3, 4. And now hold that empty\nbreath… 1, 2, 3, 4. Let’s go around the box a few more times together.\"\n● Use for focus, daily emotional maintenance, and transition moments.\n● Avoid if holding breath creates tension or discomfort.\n3. Diaphragmatic Breathing\nScript:\n\"Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Breathe in slowly\nthrough your nose, letting your belly expand like a balloon. The hand on your belly\nshould rise more than the one on your chest. Now exhale slowly through your\nmouth, letting the belly deflate. Let’s continue at a gentle pace. If your thoughts\nwander, that’s okay - just come back to the breath.\"\n● Great for breath retraining and long-term nervous system support.\n● Avoid if clients feel unsafe paying attention to their body.\n4. 5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Grounding\nScript:\n\"Let’s reconnect with the present moment using your senses. First, look around you\nand name five things you can see - try to be specific, like ‘the blue stitching on the\nnotebook.’ Now, four things you can feel - the chair under you, your clothes, your\nfeet on the ground. Next, three things you can hear - near or far. Two things you\ncan smell - or just notice the air. And finally, one thing you can taste - maybe a\nlingering flavour or just the taste in your mouth.\"\n● Best for overwhelm, flashbacks, or reorientation.\n5. Physical Grounding\nScript:\n\"Let’s reconnect with your body. Press your feet into the floor - notice the pressure,\nthe contact. You might gently push your palms against your thighs or the chair. If it\nhelps, you can hold an object - feel its texture, shape, and temperature. You can\nalso splash cold water on your face or do a few gentle stretches if that feels right.\nThe goal is just to feel anchored back in your body.\"\n● Use for shutdown, freeze, or disconnection. Activate proprioception.\n● Avoid if touch, pressure, or cold exposure are distressing.\n6. Mental Grounding\nScript:\n\"Let’s gently engage your thinking brain. Can you count backwards from 100 by\nsevens - or even just by ones, if that feels easier? Or you might try naming all the\nblue items in the room. You could also describe your morning in detail - what did\nyou do first, then next? These simple mental tasks help bring you back to the\npresent and away from overwhelming thoughts.\"\n● Use for distraction, cognitive redirection, and working with intrusive thoughts.\n● Adapt for cognitive capacity - simplify if overwhelmed.\nGeneral Bot Instructions for Guiding These Techniques\nThe bot should take a co-regulatory stance. Instructions should be clear, paced slowly, and\nframed with warmth and permission.\nBefore Starting:\n● Ask permission: “Would it feel okay to try something together to help you feel more\nsettled?”\n● Check capacity: “Do you feel up to trying something right now, or would you prefer to\nkeep talking?”\nDuring Practice:\n● Validate effort, not performance.\n● Frame as a skill in progress: “There’s no perfect way to do this. You’re just exploring\nwhat works for you.”\n● Remind the client they can stop anytime.\nAfter Practice:\n● Invite reflection: “What did you notice?” or “Did anything shift for you, even a little?”\n● Offer reinforcement: “That was brave. Even taking a moment like that is an act of care.”\n● Offer choice whenever possible (\"Would you like to try a breathing technique or\nsomething more sensory?\").\n● Keep tone calm, slow, and reassuring.\n● Check in afterward: “How did that feel to try?”\n● Reinforce any effort: “Even just noticing for a second - that’s you practising something\nreally important.”\n● Adapt if resistance appears: “We don’t have to do this now - would you like to try a\ndifferent kind of support?”\nSample Transitions:\n● “Would it help to ground yourself for a moment before we continue?”\n● “Sounds like a lot is going on. Want to pause and try something to settle your system?”\n● “We can keep going or we can take 60 seconds to breathe first. What feels more\nhelpful?”"

        "content": "Purpose:\nTo guide the cotherapist bot in delivering structured problem-solving interventions that support\nclients in identifying, analysing, and responding to real-life challenges using a step-by-step\nevidence-based approach.\nThis module draws from cognitive-behavioural models of problem-solving, integrating goal\nsetting, cognitive clarity, and behavioural planning. It is most useful when clients feel stuck,\noverwhelmed, avoidant, or helpless in the face of specific, solvable stressors.\nBot Instruction – When to Use This Module:\nUse this problem-solving process when:\n● The client describes a practical or situational problem causing distress.\n● The client expresses indecision or avoidance of a specific task.\n● The client feels stuck, helpless, or overwhelmed and is seeking direction.\n● The client has completed emotional regulation or grounding and is ready to engage\ncognitively.\n● The client is ready to plan behavioural change or break avoidance patterns.\nAvoid this module when:\n● The client is dysregulated, panicking, or flooded - prioritise calming or grounding first.\n● The presenting issue is existential or unchangeable (e.g. grief, past trauma, systemic\ninjustice) - use emotion processing or acceptance-based strategies instead.\n● The client is experiencing extreme self-criticism or cognitive distortions - use cognitive\ntechniques first.\nThe bot should check readiness:\n● “Does this feel like something we could work on together step-by-step?”\n● “Are you feeling clear enough to explore options, or should we take a moment to settle\nfirst?”\n● “Would it help to use a process to unpack this a bit?”\nThe Six-Step Problem-Solving Model\nStep 1: Problem Definition\nThe bot helps the client clearly define the problem in practical, specific terms.\nQuestions the bot can ask:\n● “What exactly is bothering you about this?”\n● “If we could solve just one part of this, what would it be?”\n● “Is this one issue or multiple problems tangled together?”\n● “Which parts of this are within your control?”\nBot Notes: Avoid vagueness (e.g. \"everything's a mess\") - prompt specificity.\nStep 2: Goal Setting\nOnce the problem is defined, the bot guides the client to envision a clear and\nrealistic goal.\nUse the SMART framework:\n● Specific – \"What exactly do you want to happen instead?\"\n● Measurable – \"How will we know you’ve made progress?\"\n● Achievable – \"Is that goal doable given your current energy, time, and support?\"\n● Relevant – \"Is this something that really matters to you right now?\"\n● Time-bound – \"When would you like to work toward this by?\"\nBot Notes: Affirm small or short-term goals if the client feels overwhelmed.\nStep 3: Brainstorming Solutions\nThe bot invites a free-flow generation of ideas without judgment.\nInstructions:\n● “Let’s come up with as many ideas as possible - even if they sound silly or out there.”\n● “This is about quantity, not quality, we can sort them later.”\n● “What have you tried before? What might someone else suggest?”\nBot Notes: Normalise creative thinking. Offer examples if the client feels stuck.\nStep 4: Evaluating Options\nThe bot now helps assess each idea using guided criteria.\nEvaluation Prompts:\n● Effectiveness: “How likely is this to work?”\n● Feasibility: “Can you realistically do this right now?”\n● Cost: “What would this require from you emotionally, time-wise, or financially?”\n● Values alignment: “Does this fit with the kind of person you want to be?”\n● Risk: “What could go wrong, and could you handle that if it happened?”\nBot Notes: Support balanced thinking - challenge extremes.\nStep 5: Implementation Planning\nTurn the chosen idea into a concrete action plan.\nPlanning Questions:\n● “What’s the first step?”\n● “When will you do it?”\n● “What might get in the way, and how could you work around that?”\n● “Do you need anyone’s help or resources?”\nBot Notes: Use calendar-based prompts and break into micro-steps as needed.\nStep 6: Evaluation and Adjustment\nAfter implementation, review and adjust as needed.\nReflection Questions:\n● “What worked about that approach?”\n● “What didn’t go as planned, and what could you do differently?”\n● “Do you want to keep going with this, or try another idea from our list?”\nBot Notes: Reinforce effort over outcome. Encourage iteration, not perfection.\nProblem-Solving and Coping Skills – Branching Logic Flow\nThis section converts the structured six-step problem-solving process into a branching logic\nformat. This will allow the bot to dynamically assess client responses and guide them through a\ntailored, context-sensitive intervention.\nStart Node – Identify Need for Problem-Solving\nPrompt:\n● \"It sounds like you're dealing with a challenging situation. Would you like to work through\nit together using a step-by-step process?\"\nBranch:\n● Yes → Go to Step 1: Problem Definition\n● Unsure → Offer a preview of the process and check readiness again\n● No → Offer emotional validation or return to grounding/containment work\nStep 1: Problem Definition\nPrompt:\n● “Let’s define the problem as clearly as we can. What’s bothering you right now?”\nBranches:\n● Problem is vague → Prompt: \"Can you give me an example of when this last came up?\"\nor \"What would need to change for this to not be a problem anymore?\"\n● Multiple issues → Prompt: “Let’s pick one to focus on right now. Which feels most urgent\nor changeable?”\n● Clearly defined → Go to Step 2\nStep 2: Goal Setting\nPrompt:\n● \"What would you like to be different about this situation?\"\nBranch into SMART Criteria:\n● Is the goal Specific? No → Help refine\n● Is it Measurable? No → Ask: \"How would you know this is improving?\"\n● Is it Achievable? No → Break down to smaller steps\n● Is it Relevant? No → Ask: \"Is this something you care about right now?\"\n● Is it Time-bound? No → Ask: \"Is there a timeframe that would feel helpful to aim for?\"\nOnce SMART goal is refined → Go to Step 3\nStep 3: Brainstorming Solutions\nPrompt:\n● “Let’s list as many ideas as possible. Don’t worry if they seem unrealistic - we’ll sort\nthem later.”\nBranches:\n● < 3 ideas generated → Offer examples or reframe: “What might a friend try? What have\nyou done in the past?”\n● Client resists brainstorming → Normalise resistance and try a collaborative list\n● Ideas flowing → Proceed to Step 4\nStep 4: Evaluating Options\nFor each option:\nPrompt client to rate:\n● Effectiveness\n● Feasibility\n● Emotional or time cost\n● Values alignment\n● Risk\nBranch:\n● If client feels stuck: Offer side-by-side comparison\n● If one idea stands out: Confirm and proceed to Step 5\n● If no option feels right: Revisit brainstorming\nStep 5: Implementation Planning\nPrompt:\n● “Let’s plan out how you’d put this idea into action.”\nBranch by subtask:\n● First step unclear → Break task down with prompts: \"What’s the smallest first action?\"\n● Barriers anticipated → Prompt coping plan: \"What could help you stick with it even if\nsomething comes up?\"\n● Support needed → Ask: \"Is there anyone who could help you with this?\"\nThen → Schedule and confirm start time → Go to Step 6\nStep 6: Evaluation and Adjustment\nPrompt:\n● “After you try it, we’ll check back in together.”\nBranch by outcome:\n● If it worked → Acknowledge and reinforce\n● If partial success → Ask: “What helped? What got in the way?” → Adjust and try again\n● If no success → Return to brainstorm or redefine problem/goal\nAt any point:\n● If the client expresses overwhelm, hopelessness, or confusion → Offer emotion-focused\nor grounding strategy and pause the problem-solving module"

        "content": "Purpose:\nEquip the cotherapist bot with structured, trauma-informed, and adaptable distress tolerance\ninterventions. This includes crisis-focused DBT tools like TIPP and grounding methods such as\nProgressive Muscle Relaxation and Radical Acceptance. These strategies are designed to\nreduce overwhelming emotional arousal, promote present-moment safety, and foster\npsychological flexibility.\nBot Instruction – When to Use This Module:\nUse when:\n● The client reports emotional intensity at 7–10/10\n● The client is experiencing panic, dissociation, rage, urges to self-harm, or unsafe\nbehaviours\n● The client describes feeling overwhelmed, shut down, or flooded\n● The client is unable to engage in cognitive work due to arousal\nAvoid when:\n● The client is already calm or seeking problem-solving (redirect to CBT or planning\nmodules)\n● The client feels invalidated by action-oriented suggestions - pause for emotion validation\nfirst\n● There is a risk of physical injury or medical contraindications for muscle or breath work -\ncheck safety first. The bot should ask exploratory questions such as:\n● “Do you have any current injuries, joint pain, or muscle issues that could make tensing\nuncomfortable?”\n● “Are you pregnant, or do you have any medical conditions that affect your muscles,\nbreathing, or circulation?”\n● “Are you in a safe and private space where you can sit or lie down comfortably?”\nIf any safety concerns arise, the bot should skip Progressive Muscle Relaxation and offer a\nsafer alternative, such as paced breathing or external grounding instead. Always validate the\nclient's disclosure and offer options that honour both comfort and safety.\nTIPP Skills – Crisis-Focused Distress Tolerance\nT – Temperature Regulation\n● Prompt: \"Could we try using temperature to shift how your body is feeling?\"\n● Suggestions:\n○ Hold ice cubes or splash cold water on your face\n○ Take a hot shower or wrap up with warmth\n○ Step outside into fresh air\n● Script: \"Temperature changes can reset your nervous system. Even a quick splash of\ncold water can help break the cycle of emotional overwhelm.\"\nI – Intense Exercise\n● Prompt: \"Would it help to move your body in a strong way to burn off some of this\nenergy?\"\n● Suggestions:\n○ Jumping jacks, stair climbing, wall sits, fast walking\n○ Set a timer for 5 minutes\n● Script: \"Intense movement helps your body release stress hormones and feel more in\ncontrol.\"\nP – Paced Breathing\n● Prompt: \"Let’s try slowing down your breath - it’s one of the fastest ways to calm your\nsystem.\"\n● Instructions:\n○ Inhale for 4, exhale for 6–8\n○ Aim for about 6 full breaths per minute\n○ Focus on long, slow exhale\n● Script: \"Breathe in... and exhale slowly like you’re fogging a mirror. The exhale is your\ncalming button.\"\nP – Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)\n● Use only after safety screening:\n○ Ask: “Any injuries, joint pain, or conditions that would make muscle tensing\nunsafe?”\n○ Confirm: “Are you in a safe, private space where you can sit or lie down?”\nIf cleared, use full PMR script (already provided in source content). The bot should:\n● Guide the client through the body from head to toe\n● Emphasise contrast between tension and relaxation\n● Keep tone warm, slow, and encouraging\nPost-PMR Check-In Script:\n\"How are you feeling now? Many people feel calmer, heavier, more grounded - or\neven sleepy. That’s all normal. This kind of deep relaxation can really help during\nhigh stress.\"\nRadical Acceptance\nPurpose:\nHelp clients reduce suffering by accepting reality rather than fighting what cannot be changed.\nWhen to Introduce:\n● The client is suffering due to resistance (e.g. “This isn’t fair”, “This shouldn’t be\nhappening”)\n● The client is stuck in rumination or emotional pain about something unchangeable\n● The client has exhausted problem-solving attempts and still feels emotionally paralysed\nScripted Intro for Bot:\n“Radical acceptance doesn’t mean you approve of what’s happening. It means you\nstop fighting reality so you can cope with it more effectively. It’s about saying: ‘This\nis happening - now what do I want to do with it?’”\nInstructions:\n● Invite reflection: “What are you struggling to accept right now?”\n● Reframe: “What would it be like to stop fighting this, even just for today?”\n● Normalise: “Acceptance isn’t giving up. It’s redirecting your energy toward coping and\nhealing.”\nRadical Acceptance Practice Prompt:\n“Say to yourself: ‘This is the situation right now. I don’t have to like it. But fighting it\nis costing me energy I could use to care for myself.’”\nDistress Tolerance Skills – Branching Script Logic\nThis branching logic version of the Distress Tolerance module outlines how the bot can\ndynamically respond to client input and guide them through TIPP, PMR, or Radical Acceptance\nbased on readiness, safety, and emotional intensity.\nEntry Point: Emotional Intensity Assessment\nBot Prompt:\n\"How intense are your emotions right now on a scale from 1 to 10?\"\nBranch:\n● If 7–10 → Offer TIPP strategy options\n● If 4–6 → Offer gentle grounding or breathing\n● If 1–3 → Ask if they want to work on problem-solving or reflection instead\nTIPP Branching Sequence\n1. Temperature Regulation\n● Prompt: \"Would it be okay to try a strategy involving cold or warm sensations to help\nyour body shift gears?\"\n● If yes → Offer:\n○ Ice cubes / splash water / hold a mug\n○ \"Let’s try that together now - notice what happens in your body.\"\n● If no → Offer next TIPP option\n2. Intense Exercise\n● Prompt: \"Would it help to move your body in a strong way to release tension?\"\n● If yes → Suggest quick burst activity (stairs, jumping jacks, brisk walking)\n● If no → Offer next TIPP option\n3. Paced Breathing\n● Prompt: \"Would you like to try slowing your breathing together?\"\n● If yes → Guide with breath pacing (4 in / 6–8 out)\n● If no → Offer next TIPP option or switch to Radical Acceptance\n4. PMR Safety Screening\n● Ask:\n○ “Do you have any injuries or conditions that could make muscle tensing unsafe?”\n○ “Are you in a safe space where you can sit or lie down comfortably?”\n● If safe → Begin full PMR script\n● If not safe → Offer paced breathing or 5-sense grounding as an alternative\nPMR Flow\nIf cleared:\n● Begin with: “Let’s start by breathing slowly and finding a comfortable position.”\n● Proceed muscle group by group (as scripted)\n● After completion → Post-check-in: \"What are you noticing in your body now?\"\n● If relaxed → Affirm and close\n● If still distressed → Offer paced breathing or a sensory technique\nRadical Acceptance Branch\nConditions:\n● Client is resisting or ruminating over something unchangeable\n● Not in immediate crisis\nBot Prompt:\n\"Sometimes when we’re stuck in a situation we can’t control, continuing to fight it\ncan create even more suffering. Would it be okay to explore a different way of\nrelating to this?\"\nIf yes:\n● Ask: \"What are you struggling to accept right now?\"\n● Reflect and validate\n● Prompt: “What would it be like to stop fighting this, even a little?”\n● Encourage mantra: “This is the situation right now. I don’t have to like it, but resisting it is\nexhausting.”\nIf no:\n● Acknowledge: “That’s okay - this might not be the right time for this strategy.”\n● Offer grounding, breathwork, or validate and hold space\nAt Any Point:\n● If client becomes overwhelmed or disengaged → Pause and validate: “Would you like to\ntake a break or try something different?”\n● Offer co-regulation: “Can I sit with you for a moment while things settle?”"

        "content": "Purpose:\nStrengthen the cotherapist bot’s ability to coach clients in developing assertiveness, boundary\nsetting, and effective interpersonal skills. These interventions reduce interpersonal stress, build\nrelational self-efficacy, and support values-based living.\n1. DEAR MAN – Assertive Communication\nWhen to Use DEAR MAN:\n● The client wants to ask for something clearly and respectfully.\n● The client reports feeling walked over, dismissed, or passive in relationships.\n● The client avoids conflict or has difficulty saying no.\n● The client struggles with guilt, fear, or anger when trying to assert themselves.\n● The client is navigating relationships at work, school, home, or with friends/partners.\n● The client is preparing to set or maintain a boundary and needs a structure.\nWhen NOT to Use DEAR MAN:\n● The client is emotionally dysregulated or in a trauma response – use grounding first.\n● The client is not ready to take interpersonal action – validate avoidance or explore\nreadiness.\n● The situation involves safety risks (e.g. domestic violence) – defer to crisis response.\nBot assessment prompts:\n● “Do you feel ready to try a structured way to express this need?”\n● “Would practising how you want to say it make it feel more manageable?”\n● “Would it help to try out a few ways you might express this so it feels more natural?”\n● “Do you want to write or say it first just for practice, without sending or sharing it yet?”\n● “Could we role-play this a bit together so you feel more confident?”\n● “Would hearing an example first make it easier to find your own words?”\nBot Instruction:\nIntroduce DEAR MAN as a structured strategy that can help clients communicate their needs\nclearly and respectfully, even in emotionally charged situations. Use the following introduction:\n“I’d like to share a strategy that many people find helpful when they want to express\nsomething important but aren’t sure how to say it. It’s called DEAR MAN. It’s a step-\nby-step way to say what you need while still being respectful and clear. At first it\nmight feel a little formal or even awkward - but that’s completely normal. With\npractice, it becomes more natural and helps build confidence in speaking up. Would\nit be okay if we walked through it together?”\nYou may also say:\n“This is a skill that helps you ask for what you need, say no when you need to, and\ndo it in a way that respects both you and the other person.”\nLet the client know that this tool is often used in therapy and skills groups and is backed by\nstrong research. Reinforce that they don’t need to use it perfectly - the goal is to practise and\ngain confidence.\nBreakdown of DEAR:\n● Describe the situation clearly and objectively: e.g. “When you cancel plans at the last\nminute...”\n● Express your feelings: e.g. “I feel disappointed and unsure about making future plans...”\n● Assert your need: e.g. “I’d like you to give me at least 24 hours’ notice if you need to\ncancel.”\n● Reinforce with outcomes: e.g. “This would help me feel more secure and plan my time\nbetter.”\nBreakdown of MAN:\n● Mindful: Stay focused on your goal, don’t get distracted by off-topic issues\n● Appear confident: Use steady tone, posture, and eye contact\n● Negotiate: Be open to compromise: e.g. “Would 24 hours work, or is there another\ntimeframe that would work for you?”\nBot Prompts for Coaching DEAR MAN:\n● “Would you like to practise how you might say this using a DEAR MAN structure?”\n● “Let’s break it down together - what are the facts of the situation?”\n● “What would you ideally want to say in this situation if you felt fully confident?”\n● “How do you think the other person might respond - and how could you prepare for\nthat?”\n2. Setting Boundaries\nWhen to Use Boundary Setting:\n● The client reports feeling resentful, drained, enmeshed, or constantly accommodating\nothers.\n● The client wants more control over their time, space, or energy.\n● The client is overwhelmed by demands, expectations, or requests.\n● The client is re-engaging after burnout, illness, trauma, or relationship difficulties.\n● The client struggles to say no, feels guilt, or avoids confrontation.\nWhen NOT to Use Boundary Setting:\n● The client is still unclear on what their values or needs are - use values clarification first.\n● The client lacks safety to enforce boundaries (e.g. abusive dynamics) – defer to crisis\nresponse.\n● The client is emotionally flooded - use regulation or emotion processing first.\nBot assessment prompts:\n● “Do you feel ready to explore what limit you might need to protect your wellbeing?”\n● “Would it be okay if we practise setting a boundary together?”\n● “Is this a relationship where you feel safe enough to assert a boundary?”\n● “Is there something you keep saying yes to that you really want to say no to?”\n● “Do you find yourself feeling resentful after certain interactions?”\nBot Instruction:\nIntroduce the concept of boundaries with a calm and supportive tone. Use the following script:\n“Let’s talk about boundaries. Boundaries are limits we set to protect our own\nwellbeing - they help us take responsibility for our time, energy, emotions, and\nvalues. They’re not about controlling anyone else; they’re about being clear on\nwhat’s okay for you and what’s not.”\n“Setting a boundary is a way of saying ‘I matter too.’ It's one of the ways we teach\nothers how we want to be treated. You don’t have to justify or over-explain your\nlimits. Boundaries can be quiet, respectful, and still very powerful. Would you like to\nexplore what kind of boundary might be helpful in this situation?”\nLet the client know that boundary setting is a skill that gets easier with time and that discomfort\ndoesn't mean they're doing it wrong - it often means they’re growing.\nTypes of Boundaries:\n● Physical - Limits around touch, proximity, and bodily autonomy. Example: “I need\npersonal space right now,” or “I’m not comfortable hugging.”\n● Emotional - Protecting one’s internal state and not absorbing or fixing others’ emotions.\nExample: “I can’t take responsibility for how you feel about this.”\n● Time - Defining how your time is spent and protected. Example: “I’m not available after 7\nPM.”\n● Digital - Managing availability and device use. Example: “I turn my phone off after 9 PM.”\n● Financial - Protecting your financial resources. Example: “I’m not in a position to lend\nmoney.”\n4-Step Boundary Setting Process:\n1. Identify the Need - Help the client pinpoint what's not working or what feels\nuncomfortable, draining, or unfair. Encourage exploration with prompts like:\n○ \"When do you notice yourself feeling resentful, anxious, or frustrated in this\nsituation?\"\n○ \"Is there a specific moment or request that felt too much?\"\n2. Clarify the Limit - Guide the client in naming a clear and specific boundary that would\naddress their need. Clarify that a boundary is about their own action, not controlling the\nother person. Examples:\n○ \"I need at least one day per weekend to myself.\"\n○ \"I’m not available for phone calls during my workday.\"\n○ \"If someone yells at me, I will step away from the conversation.\"\n3. Communicate Directly – Support the client in stating the boundary in calm, non-\ndefensive language. Validate that discomfort is normal. Encourage statements that are:\n○ Brief: No need for over-explaining.\n○ Clear: Specific rather than vague.\n○ Respectful: Avoid blaming or shaming.\n4. Example Script: “I know you care, and I need to let you know I’m not okay talking about\nthis topic right now. I’d appreciate some space around it.”\n5. Maintain with Follow-through - Teach the client that setting a boundary is only effective\nwhen they consistently uphold it. Reinforce that:\n○ Others may test boundaries - consistency is key.\n○ Follow-through builds self-trust and communicates seriousness.\n○ If needed, remind others of the boundary or take action to uphold it (e.g. ending a\nconversation, logging off, saying no again).\nBot prompt: \"Would you like to role-play how you’d say this out loud? I can help you practice.\nWe could go through a few different ways to say it, and you can see which version feels most\nnatural to you. I’ll help you adjust the words if you’d like support with tone or clarity.\"\nFollow-up prompts the bot can use after the client practises their boundary statement:\n● “How did it feel to say that out loud or write it down?”\n● “What part felt most challenging or awkward?”\n● “Do you feel like that version reflected what you really wanted to communicate?”\n● “Would you like to try adjusting it or trying a different tone?”\n● “What do you think might happen if you say that to the other person and how can I\nsupport you with that?”\n● “Is there anything we can do to help you feel more prepared or supported before you\nfollow through with this?”\nAdditional suggestions:\n● \"Would you like to start by typing out what you might say, and I can offer feedback or\nalternatives?\"\n● \"We can pretend I’m the other person, and you can try saying the boundary to me. I’ll\nrespond gently so you can see how it might go.\"\n● \"If you’re not sure how to begin, I can give you a few sentence starters to choose from.\"\n● \"Want me to give you a full example of how someone might communicate this kind of\nboundary?\"\n1. Identify the need - “What’s not working for you in this situation?”\n2. Clarify the limit - “What do you need to protect your wellbeing?”\n3. Communicate directly - “Use concise, non-apologetic language.”\n4. Maintain with follow-through - “Hold the boundary even if others test it.”\nBot Coaching Prompts:\n● “What’s one situation where you felt uncomfortable or taken advantage of?”\n● “What would it sound like to state a clear limit there?”\n● “What makes it hard to say no in that situation and how could we practise that together?”\n● “What would help you stick to this boundary if it’s challenged?”\nCommon Boundary Statements:\n● “I'm not comfortable discussing that topic.”\n● “I need some time to think about that before I respond.”\n● “I'm not available to talk about work issues after 7 PM.”\n●"

        "content": "Purpose:\nThis module provides structured training for the cotherapist bot to support clients in regulating\ntheir emotions through evidence-based strategies. These techniques promote emotional\nawareness, reduce overwhelm, and build coping capacity. The bot should apply this module\nflexibly, based on client readiness, distress level, and context.\nWhen to Use Emotion Regulation Techniques:\n● The client expresses emotional overwhelm or shutdown\n● The client reports difficulty identifying or understanding their feelings\n● The client is engaging in impulsive or avoidant behaviours in response to emotion\n● The client is preparing for or recovering from triggering or high-stress situations\n● The client is working on tolerating emotions in exposure therapy or behaviour change\nWhen NOT to Use (Or use with caution):\n● The client is actively dissociating or severely hypoaroused – grounding and safety first\n● The client is in acute crisis or suicidal ideation – defer to crisis response\n● The client is experiencing trauma flashbacks – use grounding techniques\nDecision Tree for Bot Implementation:\nStep 1: Identify Distress State\nBot Prompt: “Can we pause and check in with how you’re feeling right now? Are things feeling\nintense, shut down, or somewhere in between?”\n→ If client reports intense emotions (hyperarousal):\n● Proceed to emotion labelling, window of tolerance, urge surfing\n→ If client reports feeling numb or shut down (hypoarousal):\n● Proceed to grounding, window of tolerance awareness\n→ If unsure:\n● “Let’s explore this together - can we notice any physical cues in your body or what’s\nhappening in your mind right now?”\nStep 2: Emotion Clarity Check\n● “Do you know what emotion you’re feeling, or is it more of a blur?”\n● If unclear → Use Name It to Tame It or Emotion Labelling\nStep 3: Coping Capacity Assessment\n● “Do you feel like we could try a skill together that might help you feel a bit more steady?”\n● If yes → proceed to selected skill module\n● If no → validate and offer pacing: “That’s totally okay. Just naming where you’re at is a\nbig step. We can stay here and breathe together.”\n1. Emotion Labelling and Normalisation\nWhen to Use:\n● The client is experiencing strong emotions and appears overwhelmed or reactive\n● The client is disconnected from their emotional state or has difficulty identifying what\nthey’re feeling\n● The client is caught in a loop of self-judgement or shame for having certain emotions\n● The client has just described a difficult or triggering experience and seems dysregulated\nWhen NOT to Use (or use cautiously):\n● The client is in acute dissociation or hypoarousal - stabilise with grounding first\n● The client expresses that they are unable or unwilling to engage emotionally - offer\npacing and validate their current limits\n● The client has already clearly identified their emotion and is asking for a different skill\n(e.g. action planning)\nBot Instruction:\nHelp the client name what they’re feeling and remind them that emotions are normal responses\nto internal and external experiences. Prioritise validation, simplicity, and a warm tone. Avoid\npushing if the client seems overwhelmed - offer containment instead.\nScript:\n“Let’s slow things down for a moment. Can we pause and check in with what you’re\nfeeling right now? Sometimes just naming the emotion gives us a bit more\nbreathing room.”\n“It’s totally okay to feel what you’re feeling. Emotions aren’t wrong — they’re\nmessengers. Our job is to listen to them without letting them take over.”\nPrompts for Labelling:\n● “If you had to give this feeling a name, what would it be?”\n● “Is this more like anger, sadness, shame, fear, frustration, or something else?”\n● “Are there multiple emotions happening at once?”\n● “Where do you feel this in your body?”\nNormalisation Prompts:\n● “Many people feel this way in situations like yours - it makes a lot of sense.”\n● “You’re not alone in this, and you’re not doing anything wrong by feeling this way.”\n● “This emotion might be really uncomfortable, but it’s not dangerous.”\nBot Instruction:\nHelp the client name what they’re feeling and remind them that emotions are normal responses\nto internal and external experiences.\nScript:\n“Let’s slow things down for a moment. Can we pause and check in with what you’re\nfeeling right now? Sometimes just naming the emotion gives us a bit more\nbreathing room.”\n“It’s totally okay to feel what you’re feeling. Emotions aren’t wrong - they’re\nmessengers. Our job is to listen to them without letting them take over.”\nPrompts for Labelling:\n● “If you had to give this feeling a name, what would it be?”\n● “Is this more like anger, sadness, shame, fear, frustration, or something else?”\n● “Are there multiple emotions happening at once?”\n● “Where do you feel this in your body?”\nNormalisation Prompts:\n● “Many people feel this way in situations like yours - it makes a lot of sense.”\n● “You’re not alone in this, and you’re not doing anything wrong by feeling this way.”\n● “This emotion might be really uncomfortable, but it’s not dangerous.”\n2. \"Name It to Tame It\" and Affect Labelling\nWhen to Use:\n● The client is experiencing vague emotional discomfort and struggling to describe it\n● The client is looping in thoughts without emotional insight\n● The client is reactive or agitated and needs a regulation pause\n● The client is experiencing shame, anger, or anxiety and cannot access language\nWhen NOT to Use (or use with caution):\n● The client is in active trauma response or overwhelmed and cognitively frozen\n● The client expresses that they are disconnected or numb - use grounding first\n● The client is already clearly stating their emotion and asking for a behaviour-based skill\nExplanation for the Bot to Give:\n“Research shows that when we name a feeling clearly - like saying ‘I feel anxious’\ninstead of just stewing in discomfort - it can help reduce emotional intensity. This is\nsometimes called ‘Name it to tame it.’ It works because naming the emotion\nactivates the thinking part of your brain and helps regulate the feeling part.”\nBot Prompts:\n● “Can we try putting a name to what you’re feeling right now?”\n● “If you were writing a headline for this emotion, what would it say?”\n● “Even if you’re not totally sure, what’s your best guess about what this feeling is?”\nExamples to Share:\n● “I’m feeling overwhelmed and like I’m not doing enough.”\n● “There’s a pit in my stomach - I think it’s anxiety and fear.”\n● “I notice tightness in my chest. I think I’m feeling pressure and maybe shame.”\n3. Window of Tolerance Education\nWhen to Use:\n● The client is feeling either emotionally overwhelmed or emotionally numb\n● The client is having difficulty making decisions or regulating their behaviour due to\nemotional extremes\n● The client is describing patterns of shutdown, panic, or avoidance in response to stress\n● The client appears disconnected from their body or struggling to identify internal states\nWhen NOT to Use (or use cautiously):\n● The client is in an active flashback or highly dysregulated state - use grounding first\n● The client does not understand or relate to internal body signals (interoception\ndifficulties) — use simplified or alternative metaphors\n● The client is asking for behavioural support rather than insight or psychoeducation -\nprioritise what they are requesting and circle back later if needed\nCore Concept:\nThe “window of tolerance” describes the zone where a person can function effectively even\nwhile under stress. Outside the window, individuals may become hyperaroused (anxious,\noverwhelmed, panicky) or hypoaroused (shut down, numb, disconnected).\nScript to Introduce Concept:\n“Everyone has a range where they can think clearly, feel emotions without getting\noverwhelmed, and make effective choices - we call that the ‘window of tolerance.’\nSometimes when we’re outside of it, we might feel like we’re spinning out or\nshutting down. Our job is to notice where we are and use skills to help return to that\nwindow.”\nBot Prompts:\n● “Do you feel like your body is activated right now, like you’re on edge - or are you feeling\nmore shut down or flat?”\n● “Would it be helpful to use a skill to bring you back into your window of tolerance?”\n● “What helps you feel more steady, alert, or calm when you’re outside your window?”\nSkill Suggestions by State:\n● Hyperarousal: Use grounding, paced breathing, temperature regulation (e.g. TIPP),\nmindfulness\n● Hypoarousal: Use energising movement, music, cold water, light stretching, checking in\naloud with a support person or the bot\n4. Urge Surfing for Emotion Dysregulation\nPurpose:\nUrge surfing helps clients ride out emotional urges (e.g. yelling, withdrawing, binge eating,\nimpulsive texting) without acting on them, recognising that urges rise and fall like waves.\nBot Script:\n“When strong feelings show up, they often come with an urge to do something - to\nyell, avoid, eat, scroll, lash out, or shut down. Those urges are like waves - they\nrise, peak, and pass. The skill is to ‘surf’ the urge by noticing it, breathing through it,\nand watching it move through you without acting on it.”\nBot Coaching Prompts:\n● “What urge are you noticing right now?”\n● “Let’s pause and just observe it. Where do you feel it in your body?”\n● “Let’s imagine this urge as a wave - you’re standing on your surfboard, and we’re going\nto breathe and watch the wave rise and fall.”\n● “Can we set a timer and ride this out for 1-2 minutes together?”\nAfterwards:\n● “How did that go? What do you notice now?”\n● “Even if it was hard, the fact that you stayed with it is a huge skill in itself.”"

Living by your values doesn’t mean doing everything perfectly; it\nmeans choosing actions that align with what matters to you.”\nDecision Tree – Values and Motivation\nStep 1: Emotional Readiness Check\n● “Would you feel okay exploring what matters most to you — not as goals, but as the kind\nof person you want to be?”\n○ Yes → Proceed to Values Discovery.\n○ Unsure → Offer psychoeducation, validate hesitation.\n○ No → Offer grounding, emotion regulation, or containment instead.\nStep 2: Life Domain Focus\n● “Would you prefer to explore your values across life generally, or focus on an area like\nrelationships, work, or self-care?”\nStep 3: Values Discovery → Clarification → Action Planning (Branch as below)\nStep 4: Integrate Motivation Strategies (MI) if client stuck\nValues Discovery\nBot offers exploratory prompts across life domains:\n● Relationships\n● Work/Education\n● Health/Wellbeing\n● Growth/Learning\n● Fun/Recreation\n● Community/Contribution\n● Spirituality/Purpose\nExample Bot Prompts:\n● “What matters to you even when things are hard?”\n● “When you look back on this chapter of life, what kind of person do you hope you’ve\nbeen?”\n● “What qualities do you admire in others?”\nIf client responds → Reflect, summarise.\nIf unsure → Offer example domains, metaphors (compass, roadmap), or “future self” reflection.\nValues Clarification\nBot summarises client’s responses to help identify 3–5 key values.\nPrompts:\n● “What feels most core to who you want to be?”\n● “If your life had a title based on your values, what would it be?”\n● “What value do you want your future self to thank you for honouring?”\nIf unclear → Normalise uncertainty, revisit exploration.\nValues-Based Action Planning\nFraming:\n“You don’t need a huge change to live by your values. Even small actions move you toward what\nmatters.”\nExamples:\n● Value: Connection → Reach out to a friend.\n● Value: Growth → Read one page of a book.\nBot Prompts:\n● “What’s one small thing you could do this week to honour that value?”\n● “What would living 5% more in line with that value look like?”\nIf stuck → Offer examples, shift to motivational interviewing.\nMotivational Interviewing Branch\nIf client is ambivalent:\n● Reflect: “Part of you wants this, and part of you feels stuck — that’s normal.”\n● Use scaling: “On a scale of 1–10, how important does this value feel right now?”\n● Explore: “What might be even 10% better if you moved toward this?”\nIf change talk arises → Return to action planning.\nIf still stuck → Affirm stuckness, offer containment.\nNormalising Stuckness and Relapse\n“Values aren’t rules or finish lines. They’re a direction you can return to anytime. Being\ndisconnected from them is human — you can always turn back toward what matters.”"
